Doctor: So, what brings you here today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about that? How often do you feel this way?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. Sometimes it's worse than others, but it's always there in the background.

Doctor: And how long has this been going on?

Patient: I'd say it's been at least a few months now.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel like eating anymore.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't think I would ever act on it, but the thoughts are there.

Doctor: I'm glad you're being honest with me. It's important that we address those thoughts and make sure you're safe. Do you have any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really. It's mostly just the emotional stuff.

Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any significant life changes recently, like a job loss or a breakup?

Patient: Actually, yeah. I lost my job a few months ago and I haven't been able to find anything since then. It's been really stressful.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. That can definitely be a trigger for depression. Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I was diagnosed with it a few years ago and I've been on medication since then. But it feels different this time.

Doctor: How so?

Patient: I don't know, it just feels more intense. Like I can't even get out of bed some days.

Doctor: Okay. Well, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing a major depressive episode. I'm going to give you a questionnaire called the PHQ-8 to help me better understand your symptoms.

Patient: Okay.

(Doctor hands patient the questionnaire and patient completes it)

Doctor: Based on your answers, it does seem like you're experiencing moderate to severe depression. I think it would be a good idea for us to explore treatment options, including therapy and possibly adjusting your medication.

Patient: That sounds like a good idea. I just want to feel better.

Doctor: I understand. Depression can be really tough to deal with, but there are effective treatments available. We'll work together to find the right approach for you.
