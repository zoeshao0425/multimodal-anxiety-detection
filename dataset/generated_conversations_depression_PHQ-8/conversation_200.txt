Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I’ve been feeling really down and sad most of the time.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How often do you feel this way?

Patient: It’s pretty much every day. I wake up feeling really low and it doesn’t really get better throughout the day.

Doctor: Okay, and how long has this been going on for?

Patient: I’d say maybe a few months now. It’s been getting worse over time.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been having trouble sleeping and I’ve lost my appetite. I just don’t really feel like eating anymore.

Doctor: And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: Definitely. I feel really tired all the time, even when I haven’t really done anything.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been feeling really worthless lately. Like I’m not really doing anything right and I’m just a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: I’ve had some thoughts about it, but I haven’t acted on them or anything.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a bit about your personal background? Do you have a history of depression or mental illness in your family?

Patient: Yeah, my mom has struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. And I’ve had some issues with anxiety in the past.

Doctor: Okay, that’s good to know. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of depression. I’d like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. We can also discuss medication options if you’re interested.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help.
