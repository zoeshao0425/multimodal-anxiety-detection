Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any of the following symptoms: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than I used to, and I've lost some weight as a result.

Doctor: How about changes in your sleep patterns? Have you been sleeping more or less than usual?

Patient: I've been having trouble falling asleep at night, and when I do finally fall asleep, I wake up feeling tired and groggy.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued during the day?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time, even after getting a full night's sleep.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating, making decisions, or remembering things?

Patient: Yes, I find myself forgetting things a lot more often than I used to, and I have trouble focusing on tasks at work.

Doctor: Finally, have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: I have to admit that I have had some dark thoughts lately. It's like I'm stuck in this rut, and I can't see a way out.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. This is a common condition that affects many people, and there are treatments available that can help. I would like to refer you to a mental health professional who can work with you to develop a treatment plan that meets your specific needs.
