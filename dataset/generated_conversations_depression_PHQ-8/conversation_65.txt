Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing depression. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and have been struggling to find work. My wife and I have been fighting a lot, and my kids don't seem to listen to me anymore. I just feel like a failure.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've been under a lot of stress lately. Depression can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, brain chemistry, and life events. It's important to know that depression is a treatable condition. I'm going to recommend that you see a mental health professional who can help you develop a treatment plan.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to feel better.

Doctor: That's great to hear. In the meantime, try to take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and staying active.
