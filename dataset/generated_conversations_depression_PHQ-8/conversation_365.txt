Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not very good. I've been feeling really down and unmotivated.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little more about how you're feeling?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad all the time. I don't enjoy doing things that I used to love, like going out with friends or playing sports. I just want to stay in bed all day.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been eating much lately and I have trouble falling asleep at night. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts or anything like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like nothing I do matters and I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard for me to focus on anything. I have trouble making even small decisions, like what to eat for breakfast.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, but I have been feeling really tired all the time.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. In the meantime, there are some things you can do at home to help manage your symptoms, like getting regular exercise and trying to maintain a healthy diet. We'll work together to get you feeling better.
