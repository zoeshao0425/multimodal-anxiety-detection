Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: I've been feeling really down and sad. Sometimes I feel like I don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up several times during the night.

Doctor: What about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes there?

Patient: I've lost my appetite. I used to love food, but now I just don't feel hungry at all.

Doctor: Do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, I find it hard to focus on anything for very long. I also struggle with making even small decisions, like what to wear or what to eat.

Doctor: Have you felt guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yes, I often feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault. I feel like I'm a burden on the people around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yes, sometimes I feel like life isn't worth living and that everyone would be better off without me.

Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about your personal background? Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant life changes recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and since then, I've been struggling to make ends meet. I've also been dealing with some family issues that have been weighing on me. And I guess I've always struggled with anxiety and low self-esteem.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'm going to recommend that you see a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. In the meantime, I'd like to prescribe you an antidepressant medication to help alleviate some of your symptoms.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'm really glad that I came in to talk to you.
