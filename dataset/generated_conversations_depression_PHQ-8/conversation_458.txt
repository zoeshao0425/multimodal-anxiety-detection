Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, I haven't been feeling great. I've been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Can you describe what that feels like?

Patient: It's like I have no energy or motivation to do anything. I don't enjoy things that I used to love doing. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life without any purpose.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I have. I feel like there's no point in living anymore and that everyone would be better off without me.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really. It's mostly just the emotional stuff.

Doctor: Have you experienced any traumatic events or major life changes recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find work. It's been really stressful and I feel like a failure.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health professional who can help you manage your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.
