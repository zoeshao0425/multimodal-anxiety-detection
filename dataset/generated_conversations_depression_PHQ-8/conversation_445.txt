Doctor: Can you tell me a little about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling pretty down. I don't really feel like doing anything anymore. I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just want to stay in bed all day.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep.

Doctor: How about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes there?

Patient: I've been eating a lot less than I used to. I just don't really have an appetite anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more fatigued than usual?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I feel tired all the time, even when I haven't really done anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a lot of trouble with that. I used to be able to focus on things for hours, but now I can barely concentrate for a few minutes.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable or easily agitated than usual?

Patient: Yeah, I've been getting really frustrated with things that I used to be able to handle. Little things just set me off now.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling like everything is pointless. I don't really see the point in doing anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't think I would actually do anything, but I've definitely thought about it.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'm going to diagnose you with depression and recommend that you start treatment as soon as possible.

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid of that. But I'm glad to know what's going on and that there's something I can do about it.
