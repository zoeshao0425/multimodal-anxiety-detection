Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake it off.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little more about how you've been feeling?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really sad and hopeless. I don't enjoy things that I used to enjoy, and I have trouble sleeping at night.

Doctor: How long has this been going on?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite and I've lost some weight as well.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of suicide or self-harm?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any physical symptoms like headaches or stomach aches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? What's been going on recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and haven't been able to find anything since then. My wife and I have been fighting a lot, and my kids are having trouble in school.

Doctor: I see. That sounds like a lot of stressors. Have you talked to anyone about these issues?

Patient: Not really. I don't have anyone I feel comfortable talking to.

Doctor: Okay. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. We'll need to do some more tests to confirm the diagnosis, but I'm going to recommend that you start therapy and possibly medication.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I'm just glad to know that there's something I can do about it.
