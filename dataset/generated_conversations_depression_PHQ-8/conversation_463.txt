Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Not too good, to be honest. I've been feeling really down and unmotivated.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little more about how you're feeling?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad all the time. I don't really enjoy things that I used to, and I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I also have trouble sleeping at night.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual. I just don't really have an appetite anymore.

Doctor: Do you ever feel guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I feel like I'm not doing anything right and that I'm a burden on my family and friends.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy level?

Patient: Yeah, I'm always tired and I just don't have any motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. We can talk more about treatment options, but I want you to know that you're not alone and there are ways to feel better.
