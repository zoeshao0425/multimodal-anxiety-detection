Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad. I don't have much energy and I don't feel motivated to do anything.

Doctor: When did you first start feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. It started after I lost my job and then my girlfriend broke up with me.

Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I have a hard time falling asleep at night and then I wake up really early in the morning and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Okay. And what about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes there?

Patient: I haven't had much of an appetite lately. I've lost some weight because I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable or easily angered than usual?

Patient: Yeah, I have. Little things seem to set me off and I get really frustrated.

Doctor: Have you noticed any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really. Sometimes I feel achy all over, but I think that's just from lying in bed all day.

Doctor: Finally, have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I have. I've been feeling really hopeless and like there's no point in going on.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'm going to recommend some treatment options for you, but I want you to know that you're not alone and there is help available.
