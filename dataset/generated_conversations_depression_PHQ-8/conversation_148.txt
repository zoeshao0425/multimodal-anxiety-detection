Doctor: So, I understand that you're here today because you've been feeling down lately. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad all the time. Like, I don't even want to get out of bed in the morning.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight? 

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and I've lost some weight.

Patient: Yeah, I can't fall asleep easily and I wake up a lot during the night.

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: I see. And have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?
