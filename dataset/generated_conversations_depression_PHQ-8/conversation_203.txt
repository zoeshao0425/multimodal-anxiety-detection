Doctor: Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. 

Doctor: You're welcome. Remember, depression is not your fault, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. It takes courage to seek help, and I'm here to support you.
