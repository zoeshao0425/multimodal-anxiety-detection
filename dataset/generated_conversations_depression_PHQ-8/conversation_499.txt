Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately? Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have much energy or motivation to do anything. I used to enjoy going out with friends and doing things, but now I just want to stay home all the time.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I feel like everything I do is pointless and that I'm not good enough at anything. I keep thinking that things will never get better.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping or eating?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. And I've lost my appetite too. Food doesn't really appeal to me anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable or easily agitated than usual?

Patient: Yeah, I've been snapping at people for no reason and getting angry over small things. I don't know why I'm like this.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Sometimes I think about how much easier it would be if I just wasn't around anymore. But I don't think I would actually do anything.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or body aches?

Patient: Yeah, I've had headaches and my body feels achy all the time. I don't know if it's related to how I'm feeling emotionally or not.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. We can work together to come up with a treatment plan that will help you feel better.
