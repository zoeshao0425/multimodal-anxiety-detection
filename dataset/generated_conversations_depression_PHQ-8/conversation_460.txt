Doctor: Hi, can you tell me about any symptoms of depression you’ve been experiencing lately?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been feeling really down and hopeless. It’s like I can’t find any joy in anything anymore.

Doctor: Okay, that’s definitely a symptom of depression. Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual, and I’ve lost my appetite. I just don’t feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your energy level or motivation to do things?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really tired all the time, and I don’t feel like doing anything. Even simple tasks like getting out of bed or taking a shower feel really difficult.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been feeling like I’m not good enough and that I’m a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been having thoughts of ending my life. It’s like the only way out of this pain.

Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced any major life events or stressors recently?

Patient: Yeah, I lost my job a few months ago, and since then, I’ve been struggling to make ends meet. It’s been really stressful, and I feel like I’m letting my family down.

Doctor: I understand. Depression can often be triggered by stressful life events. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing moderate to severe depression. I’d like to refer you to a therapist who can work with you to develop a treatment plan that best suits your needs.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate your help.
