Doctor: So, let's start with the first question. Over the last two weeks, how often have you been feeling little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: Almost every day. I don't feel like doing anything, not even things that I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Okay. And have you experienced any significant changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yes, I've been eating less than usual and have lost a few pounds.

Doctor: How about feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness? Have you been experiencing those?

Patient: Definitely. I feel like everything is pointless and that I'm worthless. I don't see the point in doing anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been having trouble sleeping. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. And then I feel tired during the day.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more tired or fatigued than usual?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time. Even getting out of bed in the morning feels like a struggle.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yes, I can't focus on anything. My mind feels foggy, and I can't make even simple decisions.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicidal ideation?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, I have. I've been feeling so hopeless and worthless that I've thought about ending my life.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're experiencing several symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and I haven't been able to find another one. I'm struggling to pay my bills, and I feel like I'm letting down my family. I've been feeling really isolated too, since I don't have many friends in this city.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been going through a lot of stress and uncertainty. I think it's important that we address your depression symptoms as soon as possible. I'm going to diagnose you with depression and recommend that we start treatment right away. 

Patient: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate your help.
