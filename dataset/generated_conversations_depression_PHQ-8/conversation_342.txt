Doctor: I'm glad you came in today. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. Like, I don't have any energy and I don't enjoy things like I used to.

Doctor: Okay, that's definitely a symptom of depression. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: And have you noticed any changes in your mood? Do you feel sad or hopeless most of the time?

Patient: Yeah, I feel pretty hopeless. Like nothing is ever going to get better. And I cry a lot more than I used to.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus lately. I forget things easily and I have trouble making even simple decisions.

Doctor: Alright, and have you been feeling restless or slowed down physically?

Patient: I've definitely been feeling slowed down. I don't have much energy and I don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression before?

Patient: No, I haven't. But I've been feeling like this for a few months now and it's really affecting my daily life.

Doctor: I understand. Depression is a very treatable condition and there are a number of different options we can explore to help you feel better. Would you be open to discussing some treatment options with me?

Patient: Yes, please. I really want to get better.
