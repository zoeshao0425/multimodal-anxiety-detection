Doctor: So, how have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling pretty down. It's like everything is a struggle and I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? Do you feel sad or hopeless most of the time?

Patient: Yeah, I would say so. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness and hopelessness. Even when good things happen, I don't feel any joy or happiness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: My appetite has definitely decreased. I just don't feel hungry anymore and I have to force myself to eat. And my sleep has been really disrupted. I have trouble falling asleep and then I wake up multiple times during the night.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like fatigue or aches and pains?

Patient: Yes, I feel tired all the time, even if I haven't done much. And I have these constant headaches that won't go away.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pause) Yes, I have. I don't know what to do about it though.

Doctor: It's important that you talk to someone about those thoughts. We can help you get the support you need. Now, have these symptoms been impacting your daily life, like work or relationships?

Patient: Definitely. I've been struggling to focus at work and I've missed a few days because I just couldn't bring myself to go in. And I don't really want to be around my friends or family. I just feel like a burden to them.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you've told me, I believe you are experiencing depression. It's a common and treatable condition, and there are many options available to help you feel better. Would you be open to exploring some of those options with me?
