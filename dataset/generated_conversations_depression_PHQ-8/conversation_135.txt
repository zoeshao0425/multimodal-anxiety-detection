Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down for the past few weeks. I don't have much energy, and I don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well at all. And I haven't had much of an appetite either.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable than usual?

Patient: Yeah, I guess so. I've been getting frustrated really easily, even over small things.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I don't really feel like doing anything anymore. Even things that I used to love don't seem appealing to me right now.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless lately. Like nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, not really. I mean, I've thought about how things might be easier if I wasn't here, but I wouldn't actually do anything.
