Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I’ve been feeling really down lately. I just can’t seem to shake it.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It’s been going on for a few weeks now. I just feel sad all the time, like there’s a weight on my chest. I don’t enjoy things that used to make me happy, and I’m having trouble sleeping.

Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any other changes in your mood or behavior?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been feeling really hopeless and worthless. I don’t think I’m good at anything anymore. And I’ve been having a hard time concentrating at work.

Doctor: Okay. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: That’s good to hear. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like changes in appetite or energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve lost my appetite and I’m always tired. I just want to stay in bed all day.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let’s move on to some more specific questions. Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems: little interest or pleasure in doing things, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, trouble falling or staying asleep, feeling tired or having little energy, poor appetite or overeating, feeling bad about yourself, that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down, trouble concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper or watching television, moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed?

Patient: I’ve been bothered by all of those things pretty much every day.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. This is a common condition that affects millions of people every year. But the good news is that there are effective treatments available.

Patient: Really? That’s good to hear. I was worried that something was seriously wrong with me.

Doctor: No, you’re not alone in this. Depression is a medical condition, just like any other illness. And it’s treatable. We can discuss some treatment options that might be right for you, such as therapy or medication. But the first step is recognizing that you need help, and I’m glad you came in today.
