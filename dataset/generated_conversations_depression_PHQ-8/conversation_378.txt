Doctor: So, how have you been feeling lately? Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling really down and sad for the past few weeks. I don't feel like doing anything, and I've lost interest in things that used to bring me joy.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about your feelings of sadness? How often do you experience them, and how long do they last?

Patient: I feel sad almost every day, and it lasts for most of the day. I just feel really hopeless and helpless, like nothing is ever going to get better.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual, and I have trouble falling asleep at night. I also wake up really early in the morning and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: And how about your energy level? Have you been feeling more tired than usual?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I feel exhausted all the time, even when I haven't done anything physically demanding.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I've been feeling like life isn't worth living anymore, and I've been thinking about ways to end my life.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced any traumatic events or major life changes recently?

Patient: Well, my parents got divorced a few months ago, and that's been really hard on me. I also lost my job a few weeks ago, which has been really stressful.

Doctor: I see. Those are definitely difficult things to go through. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing major depressive disorder. I would like to refer you to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment.

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help.
