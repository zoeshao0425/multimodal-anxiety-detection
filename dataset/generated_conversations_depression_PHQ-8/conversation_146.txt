Doctor: So, what brings you here today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I don't know why, but I just feel sad all the time.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about how you've been feeling?

Patient: Well, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And I've lost my appetite. I used to love eating, but now I just don't feel hungry.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time. And I just don't have any motivation to do anything. I used to enjoy going out with friends, but now I just want to stay at home.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting anyone else, but sometimes I do feel like it would be easier if I wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything I do is wrong. I just feel like a failure.

Doctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that with me. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, I haven't had any physical symptoms.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options. In the meantime, please reach out to someone you trust if you are feeling overwhelmed or having any thoughts of self-harm.
