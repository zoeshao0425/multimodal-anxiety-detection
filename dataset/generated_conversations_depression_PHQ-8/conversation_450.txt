Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? Have you been feeling sad or empty most of the day, nearly every day?

Patient: Yeah, I would say so. It's like this cloud just follows me around all day long.

Doctor: And have you lost interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Definitely. I used to love playing guitar and going out with friends, but now I just don't have the energy for it.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've actually been eating more than usual, but I haven't gained any weight. I just feel like I need something to distract me from how I'm feeling.

Doctor: And how about your sleep? Have you been sleeping too much or too little?

Patient: I've been having trouble falling asleep at night, but then I can't seem to get out of bed in the morning. It's like I'm exhausted all the time.

Doctor: Have you been feeling restless or slowed down?

Patient: Definitely slowed down. It's like everything takes so much effort these days.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued a lot?

Patient: Yeah, constantly. Even when I wake up after a full night's sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: And have you been feeling worthless or guilty?

Patient: All the time. I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me and like I'm never doing enough.

Doctor: Lastly, have you had any thoughts of death or suicide?

Patient: I have. Sometimes it feels like the only way out of this constant sadness and despair.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I want to assure you that you're not alone and that there are treatments available to help you feel better. Let's talk about some options for managing your depression.
