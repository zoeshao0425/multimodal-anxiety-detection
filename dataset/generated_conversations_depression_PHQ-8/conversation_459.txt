Doctor: Can you tell me a little about what's been going on lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have much energy and I'm having trouble sleeping.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really hopeless and worthless. I don't feel like doing anything anymore, even things I used to enjoy. And sometimes I just feel like crying for no reason.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced these symptoms before?

Patient: Yeah, I've had bouts of depression in the past, but this feels worse than before.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've been eating less than usual and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Have you been having any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been hard to focus on anything and I've been making mistakes at work.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: I haven't had any specific plans, but sometimes I do think about how much easier it would be if I just wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I recommend we start by getting you started on an antidepressant medication and setting up regular therapy sessions to work through some of these feelings.
