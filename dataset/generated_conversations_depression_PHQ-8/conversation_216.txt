Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling really down. I don't have much motivation to do anything and I'm always tired.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How often do you feel tired?

Patient: Pretty much all the time. Even when I get a full night's sleep, I still feel exhausted throughout the day.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost some weight recently. I haven't really had much of an appetite.

Doctor: How about your mood? Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like everything is pointless and I can't seem to shake it off.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping, either falling asleep or staying asleep?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I usually have trouble falling asleep and then I wake up a few times during the night.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a lot of trouble with that lately. It's been affecting my work and my personal life.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pause) Yeah, I have. I don't think I would ever act on it, but the thought has crossed my mind.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to run some tests and potentially refer you to a therapist to help you manage these feelings.
