Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I don't really have much of an appetite. I've lost a few pounds recently.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really tired all the time. Even small tasks like getting out of bed or taking a shower feel like a huge effort.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough. I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything. Even simple decisions feel overwhelming.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?
