Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Not great, to be honest. I've been feeling really down.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really sad and hopeless. It's like I can't shake this feeling of emptiness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: My appetite has definitely decreased, and I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going to the gym and hanging out with friends, but now I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking energy?

Patient: All the time. Even getting out of bed in the morning feels like a chore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, actually. I've been having some pretty dark thoughts lately.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to refer you to a therapist who can provide you with additional support and treatment options. 

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid you were going to say that.

Doctor: I know it can be scary to face these kinds of feelings, but you don't have to do it alone. With the right treatment, you can start feeling better and regain control of your life.
