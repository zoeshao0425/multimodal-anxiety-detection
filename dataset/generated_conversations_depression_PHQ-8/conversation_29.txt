Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, I haven't been feeling great. I've been really down and just haven't had any motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe that a little more? Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like nothing really matters and everything is kind of pointless.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or eating?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a hard time sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And I haven't really had much of an appetite lately.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy level or ability to concentrate?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time and I just can't seem to focus on anything.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I just feel like things would be better if I wasn't around.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I've been having a hard time finding something new. And my relationship with my partner has been really rocky lately. We fight all the time and I just feel really alone.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to talk to you more about that and see if we can come up with a plan to help you feel better.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. I just want to feel like myself again.
