Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: I've been feeling really down and sad. It's like everything feels hopeless.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping and I don't really have an appetite anymore.

Doctor: How about your energy levels? Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yeah, I feel exhausted all the time. Even simple tasks feel like they take so much effort.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, I have. I've been having these thoughts for a while now.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have there been any significant life events or changes that may have triggered these feelings?

Patient: My job has been really stressful lately and I've been having some relationship problems with my partner.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to formally diagnose you with depression and discuss treatment options with you.

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid that might be the case.

Doctor: It's okay. Depression is a common condition and there are effective treatments available. We can work together to find the best treatment plan for you.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
