Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. Based on your answers, I would diagnose you with moderate to severe depression.

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid you were going to say that.

Doctor: It's important to remember that depression is a medical condition, and it's not your fault that you're feeling this way. There are treatments available that can help you feel better.

Patient: (nods) What kind of treatments?

Doctor: There are different options we can explore, such as therapy, medication, or a combination of both. It's important to find what works best for you.

Patient: (looks relieved) Okay, I'm willing to try anything to feel better.

Doctor: That's great to hear. I'll refer you to a therapist and we can discuss medication options as well. In the meantime, it's important to take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying active.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.

Doctor: Of course, that's what I'm here for. We'll work together to help you feel better.
