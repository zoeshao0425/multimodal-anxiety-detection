Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately? Have you been feeling down or depressed?

Patient: Yeah, I have been feeling really down for the past few weeks. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I just feel really tired all the time.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Have you experienced any loss of interest in things you normally enjoy doing?

Patient: Yeah, actually, I used to love going for runs in the park or meeting up with friends, but now I just don't feel like doing anything. I don't even feel like watching TV or reading anymore.

Doctor: That sounds tough. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and I've lost a few pounds. I just don't have much of an appetite anymore.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping or noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a hard time falling asleep at night and then I wake up really early in the morning and can't fall back asleep. It's been really frustrating.

Doctor: I see. Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, actually, I've been feeling really bad about myself lately. I just feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting myself, but sometimes I do think it would be easier if I just didn't exist.

Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced any traumatic events in your life?

Patient: Yeah, actually, when I was younger, my parents got divorced and it was really hard on me. I also lost my job a few months ago, which has been really stressful.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to diagnose you with depression and discuss treatment options with you.

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help.
