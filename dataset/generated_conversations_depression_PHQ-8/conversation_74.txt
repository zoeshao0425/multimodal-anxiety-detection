Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to know that depression is a medical condition, and it's not your fault that you're feeling this way.

Patient: That's good to know. I've been feeling really guilty about not being able to snap out of it.

Doctor: It's not something you can just snap out of. Depression is a real illness that requires treatment. We have a few options for treatment, including therapy and medication. I'd like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through some of these feelings and develop coping strategies. We can also discuss medication options if that's something you're interested in.

Patient: Thank you, that sounds like a good plan. I'm ready to start feeling better.
