Doctor: Thank you for answering these questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find a new one. I also broke up with my girlfriend recently, so I've been feeling pretty lonely.

Doctor: I see. Losing a job and a relationship can definitely be difficult to deal with. It's important that we address your depression so that we can help you feel better. I recommend that we start with therapy and possibly medication to manage your symptoms. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?

Patient: Yes, I'm willing to try anything to feel better.
