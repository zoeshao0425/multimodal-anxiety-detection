Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping at night and I've lost my appetite a bit. I just don't really feel like eating much.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or motivation to do things?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really drained all the time. Even getting out of bed in the morning feels like a huge effort.

Doctor: Have you been feeling sad or hopeless lately?

Patient: Definitely. It's like everything just feels really bleak and pointless. I don't see the point in doing anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really down and unmotivated.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomach aches?

Patient: Not really, no. It's mostly just this constant feeling of sadness and fatigue.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently?

Patient: Well, my job has been really stressful lately and I haven't been sleeping well because of it. And I've been having some relationship problems with my partner.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. Additionally, medication may also be an option to help alleviate your symptoms.
