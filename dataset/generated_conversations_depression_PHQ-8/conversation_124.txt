Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on that brings you here today?

Patient: Yeah, I've just been feeling really down lately. I don't have any energy and I'm not interested in doing things that I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Have you been feeling this way for a long time?

Patient: Yeah, it's been going on for a few months now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I don't really have much of an appetite anymore.

Doctor: Do you ever feel like you're worthless or that you're letting people down?

Patient: Yeah, all the time. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm a burden to everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting myself, but sometimes I do think that everyone would be better off without me.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or body aches?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having headaches pretty frequently and my body feels achy all the time.

Doctor: Have you talked to anyone about how you've been feeling?

Patient: No, I haven't really talked to anyone about it. I didn't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: It sounds like you're experiencing several symptoms of depression. I'd like to diagnose you with depression and work with you to develop a treatment plan.
