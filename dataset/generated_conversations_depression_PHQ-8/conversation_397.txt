Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: I've just been feeling really down. Like, I don't really have any energy and I don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I haven't really been eating much and I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or interest in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it. I don't really enjoy anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable or easily frustrated than usual?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. Little things that wouldn't normally bother me are really getting on my nerves lately.

Doctor: Have you noticed any physical symptoms, like headaches or body aches?

Patient: Not really, no.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I've been having trouble finding a new one. Money's been tight and it's been really stressful.

Doctor: That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you're feeling down given everything that's been going on. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to refer you to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment.
