Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling down lately. I don't really know how to explain it.

Doctor: That's okay. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've been experiencing?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel sad all the time. It's like I can't shake this feeling of hopelessness. I don't really enjoy things that I used to enjoy, and I have trouble sleeping at night.

Doctor: Okay, those are all common symptoms of depression. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual. I've lost some weight because of it.

Doctor: And have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I feel like my mind is foggy most of the time. I have trouble focusing on anything for too long.

Doctor: Okay, and have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault. Like I'm not good enough for anything.

Doctor: Alright, and have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: That's good to hear. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Are there any major stressors or changes that may have triggered these feelings?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job. And my relationship with my partner has been rocky lately. We've been arguing a lot.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stress and change. Based on what you've told me, I would say that you are experiencing symptoms of depression. 

Patient: Really? I didn't think it was that serious.

Doctor: Depression is a very serious condition that can have a significant impact on your daily functioning. But the good news is that it's treatable. I would like to start you on a medication and recommend that you see a therapist to work through some of the issues that may be contributing to your depression.

Patient: Okay, thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
