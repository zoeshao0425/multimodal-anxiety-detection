Doctor: So I understand you're here today to talk about some symptoms you've been experiencing. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, sure. I've been feeling really down lately. It's like nothing really brings me joy anymore, and I just feel really empty inside.

Doctor: Okay, I see. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I've been having trouble sleeping at night, and I've lost my appetite. I just don't really feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels? Are you feeling more tired than usual?

Patient: Definitely. I feel exhausted all the time, even when I haven't really done anything.

Doctor: I see. And have you been feeling hopeless or helpless, like there's no way out of this feeling?

Patient: Yeah, that's exactly how I feel. It's like nothing is ever going to get better.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, no.

Doctor: Alright. And have you experienced any significant life events recently, like a loss or a major change?

Patient: Well, actually, I lost my job a few months ago. I've been struggling to find work since then, and it's been really stressful.

Doctor: I can imagine. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling, like friends or family?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden them with my problems.

Doctor: I understand, but it's important to have a support system. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?

Patient: I haven't really thought about it, but maybe I should.

Doctor: I think that would be a good idea. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'm going to give you a formal diagnosis and refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help.
