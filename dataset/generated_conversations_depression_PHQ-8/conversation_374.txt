Doctor: So, tell me what brings you here today?

Patient: I’ve been feeling really down lately. I just can’t seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling like this?

Patient: It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to affect my daily life.

Doctor: Can you describe what you mean by “affecting your daily life”?

Patient: I’m having trouble sleeping, I’m not enjoying things that I used to love doing, and I feel like I’m always tired and unmotivated.

Doctor: Okay, I understand. Have you had any changes in appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yes, I’ve lost a few pounds because I don’t feel like eating much.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness?

Patient: Yes, all the time. I feel like everything I do is pointless.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, it’s been really hard to focus on anything lately.

Doctor: Have you noticed any physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach problems?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I’d like to do a more thorough assessment to confirm this diagnosis.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: I’m going to ask you a few more questions. Have you experienced any significant life changes recently, such as a break-up or job loss?

Patient: Actually, yes. I lost my job a few months ago and haven’t been able to find another one yet.

Doctor: Okay, that could definitely contribute to your current state. Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: No, this is the first time.

Doctor: Is there a history of depression in your family?

Patient: Yes, my mother has struggled with it for years.

Doctor: That’s good to know. Based on all of this information, I’m going to diagnose you with depression. It’s a treatable condition, and we can work together to find the best treatment plan for you.
