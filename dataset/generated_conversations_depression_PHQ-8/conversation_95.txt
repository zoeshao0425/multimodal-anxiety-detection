Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: I'm always tired, no matter how much I sleep.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.
