Doctor: So, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've just been feeling really down. Like, all the time.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe that feeling a little more? Is it sadness, hopelessness, or something else?

Patient: It's definitely sadness. But it's not just sadness, it's like this heavy weight on my chest that won't go away.

Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well at all. And I've lost my appetite too.

Doctor: How long has this been going on for?

Patient: A few weeks now.

Doctor: Okay. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Alright. Have you noticed a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing video games and hanging out with friends, but now I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: I understand. Do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. It's like my brain is foggy all the time.

Doctor: Alright, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. 

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid of that.

Doctor: I want you to know that depression is a common and treatable condition. We can work together to find a treatment plan that works for you.
