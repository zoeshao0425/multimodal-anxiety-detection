Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I’ve been feeling really down lately. I just can’t seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: For the past few weeks, I’ve been feeling really low. I don’t have any energy, and I’m not interested in doing anything. Even things that used to make me happy don’t anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I’m not really hungry, and I have trouble falling asleep at night. I’m also waking up earlier than usual.

Doctor: Okay. How about feelings of guilt or worthlessness? Do you experience those?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault. I’m always second-guessing myself and my decisions. And I feel like I’m not good enough, no matter what I do.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven’t.

Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomach aches?

Patient: Not really. Just a general feeling of fatigue and lethargy.

Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me a bit about your personal life? Are you going through any major life changes or stressors right now?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job, and I’ve been having trouble finding another one. And my relationship with my partner has been strained lately.

Doctor: I see. Those are definitely stressful situations. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I’d like to do a full assessment to get a better idea of how severe your symptoms are.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

After conducting the full assessment, the doctor diagnoses the patient with depression and discusses treatment options, including therapy and medication. The doctor also recommends lifestyle changes, such as exercise and self-care practices, to help manage symptoms. The patient expresses relief at finally having a diagnosis and is hopeful about starting treatment.
