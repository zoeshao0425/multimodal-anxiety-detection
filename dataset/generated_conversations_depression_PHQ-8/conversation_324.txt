Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. Like, nothing makes me happy anymore.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less and I have trouble falling asleep at night.

Doctor: Okay, and have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like nothing I do matters and that I'm just a burden to everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't think I would actually do anything, but the thoughts are there.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. It's important that we address those thoughts and make sure you're safe. Have you experienced any loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing guitar but I haven't touched it in months. It just doesn't bring me any joy anymore.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or ability to concentrate?

Patient: I feel exhausted all the time and I have trouble focusing on even simple tasks.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to do a full assessment and get you started on some treatment options. 

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid that might be the case. But I'm glad we can do something about it. 

Doctor: Absolutely. Depression is a very treatable condition and there are many options available. We'll work together to find the best approach for you.
