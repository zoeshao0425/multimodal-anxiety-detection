Doctor: Can you tell me how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, it's hard to put into words. I just feel really down and sad most of the time.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and have lost quite a bit of weight.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or do you find yourself sleeping more than usual?

Patient: I have a really hard time falling asleep at night and then I wake up really early in the morning and can't get back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy level or motivation?

Patient: I feel so tired all the time and just don't have the energy to do anything. Even getting out of bed in the morning is a struggle.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and I'm not good enough. I just feel really worthless.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I've had some thoughts like that. I don't think I would actually do anything, but the thoughts are there.

Doctor: Thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to know that depression is a medical condition and it's not your fault. There are treatments available that can help you feel better. 

Patient: (sighs) It's a relief to know that there's a reason for how I've been feeling. What kind of treatments are available?

Doctor: There are a few different options, including therapy and medication. I think it would be best for us to discuss those options in more detail at our next appointment. In the meantime, I want you to know that you're not alone and we're here to support you.
