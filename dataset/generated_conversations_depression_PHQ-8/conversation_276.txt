Doctor: So, let's start with your symptoms. How often do you feel little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: I feel that way almost every day. I don't enjoy the things I used to love doing, like playing video games or hanging out with friends.

Doctor: Okay, and how about feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: That's also something I experience almost every day. I feel like there's no point in doing anything because nothing makes me happy anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite. I used to love eating, but now I have to force myself to eat anything. I've lost a few pounds too.

Doctor: Do you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or do you sleep too much?

Patient: I have trouble sleeping. Even when I'm exhausted, I just can't seem to fall asleep. And then when I finally do, I wake up several times during the night.

Doctor: How about feeling tired or having little energy?

Patient: I feel exhausted all the time. Even when I get enough sleep, I still feel drained and unmotivated.

Doctor: Do you feel guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I do. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault. I constantly beat myself up over things that aren't even my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: I have. Sometimes I feel like life isn't worth living anymore, and I've thought about ending it all.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on your symptoms, I believe you are experiencing depression. We can discuss treatment options to help you feel better.
