Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling pretty down. It's like I can't shake this feeling of sadness no matter what I do.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it's not getting any better.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well at all. I either have trouble falling asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. And I've lost my appetite too. Food doesn't really interest me anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more tired than usual?

Patient: Definitely. Even when I do manage to get some sleep, I still feel exhausted all the time.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood? Do you find yourself feeling more irritable or easily frustrated?

Patient: Yeah, I've been really moody lately. Little things that wouldn't normally bother me are setting me off.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things that you used to enjoy doing?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with my friends and doing things, but lately, I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't know if I would ever actually do it, but the thought has crossed my mind.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I want to help you get the support and treatment you need to start feeling better.
