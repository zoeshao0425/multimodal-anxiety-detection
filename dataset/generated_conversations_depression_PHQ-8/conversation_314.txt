Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless lately. Like nothing I do really matters, and I'm just a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I don't think I'd ever actually hurt myself, but I just feel so empty and hopeless sometimes.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've definitely been having trouble with that. I just can't seem to focus on anything, and even simple decisions feel overwhelming.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like fatigue or aches and pains?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time, and my body just feels achy and heavy.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health specialist who can help you further. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.
