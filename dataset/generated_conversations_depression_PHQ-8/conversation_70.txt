Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and unmotivated.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? When did it start?

Patient: I think it started a few months ago. I just feel really sad all the time, even when there's no reason to be. I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy, like going out with friends or reading. I just feel really disconnected from everything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual, but I still feel tired all the time. And I've lost my appetite. I have to force myself to eat sometimes.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and I'm not good enough. I've been really hard on myself lately.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Definitely. I feel like my mind is always foggy and I can't focus on anything for very long.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, just some occasional aches and pains.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to schedule some follow-up appointments to discuss treatment options and help you feel better.
