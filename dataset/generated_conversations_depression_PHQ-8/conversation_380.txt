Doctor: So, how have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I’ve been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Can you tell me a bit more about that? Have you been feeling sad or empty most of the day, nearly every day?

Patient: Yes, definitely. It’s like a constant cloud hanging over me.

Doctor: And have you lost interest in things that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don’t see the point.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or having trouble sleeping?

Patient: Yes, I’ve been sleeping a lot but it doesn’t seem to help. And I wake up feeling exhausted.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I’ve been eating a lot less than usual, and I’ve lost some weight.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: All the time. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it’s like my brain is in a fog. I can’t focus on anything for very long.

Doctor: Have you had thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pause) Yeah, I have. It’s like there’s no way out of this darkness.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of depression. It’s important to know that depression is a medical condition and can be treated. We’ll work together to come up with a treatment plan that’s right for you.

Patient: (sighs) Thank you. I’ve been feeling so alone and hopeless, it’s a relief to know that there’s a way out of this.
