Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: I've been feeling pretty down, doctor. Like I just don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I just feel like I'm not good enough and that nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you been having any trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping, actually. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable or easily agitated than usual?

Patient: Yeah, I've been getting really frustrated over little things and snapping at people more often.

Doctor: Have you been having any difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard for me to focus on anything and I feel like I can't make even simple decisions.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I've been feeling really hopeless and like there's no point in going on.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, my job has been really stressful and I feel like I'm not doing well there. And my relationship with my partner has been strained lately too. I just feel like everything is falling apart.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. Based on your symptoms and what you've told me, I think it's likely that you're experiencing depression. I want to help you get the support you need to feel better. 

Patient: (sighs) Okay, thank you. I really don't want to feel like this anymore. 

Doctor: I'm going to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through some of these issues and develop coping strategies. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an antidepressant medication that can help alleviate some of your symptoms. It's important that you take it as directed and come back to see me in a few weeks so we can assess how it's working for you. 

Patient: Okay, thank you doctor. I really appreciate your help.
