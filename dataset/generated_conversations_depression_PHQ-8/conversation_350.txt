Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling pretty down. I don't really have much motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little more about that? Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really sad. It's like no matter what I do, I can't shake this feeling of sadness. And I just feel so hopeless all the time.

Doctor: How often do you feel this way?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. I wake up feeling sad and it just doesn't go away.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, my appetite has definitely decreased. I just don't feel hungry anymore. And I have trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't have any interest in it. I don't even want to get out of bed most days.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I've been having these thoughts for a while now.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, just some fatigue and a general feeling of being run down.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little about your personal background? Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup, and that's been really tough for me. But other than that, nothing too major has happened.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've described, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health specialist who can provide you with more support and resources. Would that be okay with you?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me.
