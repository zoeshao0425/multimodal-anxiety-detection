Doctor: Hi, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately?

Patient: Well, I've just been feeling really down and unmotivated. I don't have any energy or interest in doing things that used to make me happy.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms like changes in your appetite, sleep, or concentration?

Patient: Yes, actually. I haven't been sleeping well at night and I've lost my appetite. I also find it hard to concentrate on things, even simple tasks.

Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. At first, I thought it was just stress from work, but it hasn't gone away.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced anything like this before?

Patient: Yes, I have had episodes of depression in the past. The last time was about two years ago.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know.
