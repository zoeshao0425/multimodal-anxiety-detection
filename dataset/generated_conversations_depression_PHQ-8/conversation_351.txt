Doctor: So, let's start with understanding your symptoms. Over the past two weeks, have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very down lately. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and can't seem to get out of it.

Doctor: Okay, next question. Have you experienced a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it. I don't find joy in anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any significant changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yes, I've lost my appetite and have lost a few pounds as a result.

Doctor: How about changes in your sleep patterns? Have you been sleeping too much or too little?

Patient: I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you felt tired or had a lack of energy?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time. Even getting out of bed in the morning feels like a huge effort.

Doctor: Have you felt guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I feel like a failure and like nothing I do is good enough. I feel like I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pause) Yes, actually. Sometimes I feel like everything would be better if I wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. We will need to do further evaluation and testing, but I want you to know that this is a common condition and there are treatments available. In the meantime, I recommend making some lifestyle changes such as getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep. We can also discuss therapy and medication options to help manage your symptoms.
