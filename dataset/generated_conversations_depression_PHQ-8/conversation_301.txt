Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on.

Patient: Well, I just feel really down lately. Like, all the time.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. It's like I just can't shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping and I haven't been eating as much as I used to.

Doctor: Do you ever feel hopeless or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I do. I just feel like nothing I do matters and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yeah, I have. Sometimes it just feels like it would be easier if I wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or body aches?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a lot of headaches lately.

Doctor: And how has this been affecting your daily life? Are you able to go to work or school?

Patient: It's been really hard. I've had to take a lot of days off from work because I just don't feel motivated to do anything.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Do you have a support system in place?

Patient: Not really. My family lives far away and I don't have many friends.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to do some further testing to confirm this diagnosis.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: In the meantime, it's important that you take care of yourself. Try to get some exercise, eat healthy foods, and get plenty of rest. And if you ever feel like hurting yourself, please reach out for help.

Patient: Thank you, I will.
