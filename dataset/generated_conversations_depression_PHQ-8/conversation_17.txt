Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I’ve been feeling really down lately. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me a bit more about how you’ve been feeling?

Patient: Well, I’ve been feeling really sad and hopeless. I don’t enjoy things that I used to enjoy, and I feel like I have no energy.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual, and I’ve lost my appetite. I don’t feel like eating anything.

Doctor: Okay, have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yes, I feel like everything is my fault and that I’m not good enough. I feel like I’m letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Sometimes I feel like it would be better if I wasn’t here anymore, but I wouldn’t actually do anything.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a bit more about your personal background? Do you have any history of depression or other mental health issues in your family?

Patient: Yeah, my mom has struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. I’ve also had a few episodes of depression in the past, but this feels different.

Doctor: Okay, that’s good to know. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options with you.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you for listening to me.
