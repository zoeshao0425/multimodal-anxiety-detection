Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about why you came in today?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I'm having trouble sleeping, my appetite has decreased, and I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Okay, those are all symptoms of depression. Have you experienced any other symptoms?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really hopeless and worthless. I feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me.

Doctor: I see. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, not really. I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your energy level or ability to concentrate?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time and I'm having trouble focusing on things. I feel like my mind is always foggy.

Doctor: Alright, those are all common symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant life changes recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I haven't been able to find work since then. It's been really stressful trying to make ends meet, and I feel like I'm letting my family down.

Doctor: I see. That's definitely a difficult situation to be in. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: I understand, but it's important to have a support system when you're going through something like this. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?

Patient: I haven't, but maybe that would be a good idea.

Doctor: I think it would be a good idea too. In the meantime, I'm going to diagnose you with depression and prescribe an antidepressant medication. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you're doing.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate your help.
