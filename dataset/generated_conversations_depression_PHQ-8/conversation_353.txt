Doctor: So, tell me, how have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling pretty down. I don't really have much motivation to do anything anymore.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How long has this been going on?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just feel really sad all the time and I can't seem to shake it off.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms like changes in appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, my appetite has decreased a lot and I've been having trouble sleeping at night. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up multiple times during the night.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I'm always tired and I don't have much energy to do anything. Even getting out of bed in the morning feels like a chore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless. I don't feel like I'm good enough at anything and I feel like I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting myself, but sometimes I do wonder if anyone would even notice if I wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you manage your symptoms and develop coping strategies.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I was worried it might be something more serious.

Doctor: Depression is a serious condition, but it is also treatable. With the right support and treatment, you can start feeling better soon.
