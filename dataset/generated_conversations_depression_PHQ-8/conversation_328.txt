Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on lately that made you come in today?

Patient: Well, I've just been feeling really down and unmotivated. It's been going on for a while now, and I'm starting to worry that it's not just a passing phase.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe some of the specific symptoms you've been experiencing?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really sad most of the time, even when there's no particular reason to be. I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy, like spending time with friends or doing hobbies. I've also been having trouble sleeping and have been feeling really tired all the time.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and have lost some weight recently.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel like nothing I do matters and that I'm just a burden on the people around me. It's hard to shake those thoughts once they start.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't gotten to that point yet.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Can you tell me a bit about your personal background and any past experiences with mental health issues?

Patient: Sure, I've never been officially diagnosed with anything before, but I have struggled with anxiety and low mood in the past. I come from a pretty stressful family situation and have had some difficult life events happen recently that have been weighing on me.

Doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to do a full assessment to get a better idea of how severe your symptoms are and what kind of treatment would be most helpful.
