Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down. I feel like I have no energy and I'm always tired. I don't enjoy doing things that I used to love, and I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. And I don't really have much of an appetite anymore.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything I do is pointless. Like nothing really matters.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, not really. I mean, I've thought about how it would be easier if I wasn't around, but I would never actually do anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I feel like I can't focus on anything for very long, and I have a hard time making even simple decisions.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomach aches?

Patient: Not really. Just the fatigue and lack of appetite.

Doctor: Have you noticed any triggers for these feelings, like a recent loss or stressful event?

Patient: Not really. I mean, things have been kind of tough lately, but nothing major has happened.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. Additionally, I would like to prescribe an antidepressant medication to help alleviate some of these symptoms. Do you have any questions or concerns about this plan?
