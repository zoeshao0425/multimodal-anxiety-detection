Doctor: So, what brings you here today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: I see. How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you experienced any other symptoms besides feeling sad?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And I've lost my appetite too.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed a change in your energy level?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really tired all the time. Even when I get enough sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced anything like this before?

Patient: Yeah, I went through a rough patch a few years ago where I was feeling really down. But it didn't last as long as this has.

Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Are there any major stressors or changes happening right now?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and haven't been able to find anything else. And my relationship with my partner has been rocky lately.

Doctor: I see. That's definitely a lot to deal with. Do you have any support systems in place, like friends or family?

Patient: Not really. I don't have a lot of close relationships.

Doctor: Okay. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to ask you a few more questions to get a better idea of how severe your symptoms are. 

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?

Patient: Pretty much every day.

Doctor: How often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: Every day as well.

Doctor: How often have you been bothered by feeling tired or having little energy?

Patient: Every day.

Doctor: How often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?

Patient: Poor appetite every day.

Doctor: How often have you been bothered by trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much?

Patient: Every day.

Doctor: How often have you been bothered by feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down?

Patient: Every day.

Doctor: How often have you been bothered by trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?

Patient: Every day.

Doctor: And finally, how often have you been bothered by moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite - being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual?

Patient: Moving slowly every day.

Doctor: Based on your answers to these questions, it seems like you are experiencing moderate to severe depression. I would like to recommend some treatment options for you, such as therapy and medication. 

Patient: Okay, thank you.
