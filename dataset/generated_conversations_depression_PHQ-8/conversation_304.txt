Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately. Have you been feeling down or depressed?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really low lately. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I just feel like I don't have any energy.

Doctor: How long has this been going on for?

Patient: It's been about a month now.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Alright, have you noticed any changes in your interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing basketball with my friends but lately I just don't feel like doing anything. I don't have any motivation.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and I keep thinking about all the mistakes I've made in my life.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been hard to focus on anything and I feel like I can't make even simple decisions.

Doctor: Finally, have you had any thoughts of death or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to diagnose you with depression and discuss treatment options with you.

Patient: Okay, thank you for helping me understand what's been going on with me.
