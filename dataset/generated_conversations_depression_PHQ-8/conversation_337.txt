Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, to be honest, I've been feeling pretty down. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. At first, I thought it was just a bad mood or something, but it hasn't gone away.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. And my appetite has been pretty low. I just don't feel like eating much.

Doctor: Have you lost weight recently?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost a few pounds. But I don't think it's because I'm trying to lose weight or anything. I just don't have much of an appetite.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired lately. Even when I do manage to get some sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but lately I just don't feel like doing anything. I just want to stay at home and be alone.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling like I'm not good enough at anything. Like I'm just a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I don't think I would ever do anything like that.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to formally diagnose you with depression and discuss treatment options with you.
