Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: I see. How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of suicide or self-harm?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing basketball but now I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a hard time focusing at work and making even simple decisions.

Doctor: Okay. And have you experienced any physical symptoms such as fatigue or aches and pains?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time and my body just feels achy.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to do a more thorough assessment to confirm the diagnosis.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

Doctor: I'm going to give you a questionnaire called the PHQ-8. It asks about symptoms you may have been experiencing over the past two weeks. Please answer each question honestly and to the best of your ability.

(Patient completes the PHQ-8)

Doctor: Based on your responses, it appears that you are experiencing moderate to severe depression. I would like to discuss treatment options with you, including therapy and possibly medication. We can work together to develop a plan that will help you feel better.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.
