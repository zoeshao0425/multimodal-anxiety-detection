Patient: It’s been pretty much every day for the past few weeks.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things that used to bring you pleasure?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don’t feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: I’ve been eating less than usual and having trouble sleeping. I either can’t fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or have low energy?

Patient: Yes, I’ve been feeling really tired all the time. Even getting out of bed in the morning feels like a huge effort.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: I’ve had some fleeting thoughts, but I don’t think I’d actually do anything.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing depression.
