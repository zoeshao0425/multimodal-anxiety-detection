Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad most of the time. I don't really enjoy doing things that I used to love anymore, and I just feel really tired all the time.

Doctor: Okay, that's helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well at all lately. I either have trouble falling asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And I've lost my appetite too. I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: I see. And have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, not really. I mean, sometimes I feel like life isn't worth living, but I wouldn't actually do anything to hurt myself.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone or anything. Like I'm just a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: I understand. And have you had any difficulty concentrating or making decisions lately?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything. Even simple tasks take a lot of effort and I just feel really overwhelmed.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Finally, have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, no.

Doctor: Alright, thank you for answering all of those questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to know that depression is a medical condition and there are treatments available to help you feel better. I'd like to refer you to a mental health professional who can provide you with more support and guidance.
