Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have any energy, and I'm having trouble sleeping.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite, and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Do you find yourself feeling hopeless or helpless?

Patient: Yes, I feel like nothing is going right in my life, and I can't do anything about it.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends, but now I just want to stay home.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I'm having trouble focusing at work, and I can't seem to make even simple decisions.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting anyone, but sometimes I feel like I would be better off dead.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Depression is a treatable medical condition, and there are many options available to help you feel better.

Patient: (sighs) I had a feeling that might be the case.

Doctor: It's important to remember that depression is not a personal failing or weakness. It's a medical condition, and it's not your fault.

Patient: Thank you for saying that.

Doctor: We can discuss treatment options together, and I will be here to support you every step of the way.
