Doctor: Hi, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down for the past few weeks. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: I see. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I either can't fall asleep at all or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. And my appetite has definitely decreased. I just don't feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time. Even when I do manage to get some sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable or anxious than usual?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I've been getting really worked up over things that wouldn't normally bother me. And I just feel really on edge all the time.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Alright, and have you ever experienced these symptoms before?

Patient: Yeah, I've struggled with depression in the past. But this feels different. It's like I just can't shake it no matter what I do.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing another episode of depression. I'd like to run through a few more questions to get a better idea of how severe your symptoms are.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: Almost every day.

Doctor: And how often have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: Pretty much every day as well.

Doctor: Have you been feeling bad about yourself or feeling like a failure or that you've let yourself or your family down?

Patient: Yeah, a lot.

Doctor: And have you had trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?

Patient: Definitely. I can barely focus on anything these days.

Doctor: Have you been moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or have others commented on your movements being slow?

Patient: Sometimes, yeah.

Doctor: Have you been feeling restless or fidgety?

Patient: Not really.

Doctor: And have you had thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those thoughts.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering all of those questions. Based on your responses, I do think that you're experiencing a significant episode of depression. It's important that we start treating this right away so that you can start feeling better.

Patient: Okay, what kind of treatment do you recommend?

Doctor: There are a few different options we can explore, including therapy and medication. I think it would be best if we set up a follow-up appointment to discuss these options in more detail and come up with a plan that works for you. Does that sound okay?
