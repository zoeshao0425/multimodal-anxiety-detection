Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately. Have you been feeling down or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really low for the past few weeks. It's like I just can't shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I'll either have trouble falling asleep or I'll wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And as for my appetite, I haven't been eating as much as I used to.

Doctor: I see. And have you lost interest in things that you used to enjoy doing?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any physical symptoms like fatigue or aches and pains?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired lately. It's like no matter how much sleep I get, I still feel exhausted. And I've been having headaches and body aches too.

Doctor: Alright. And have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't know why, but sometimes I just feel like it would be easier if I wasn't here anymore.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. That's a very serious symptom and we need to address it right away. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced depression before?

Patient: Yeah, I've had bouts of depression in the past. It usually happens when I'm going through a tough time in my life, like a breakup or a job loss.

Doctor: Okay, and do you have a family history of depression or other mental health conditions?

Patient: Yeah, my mom has struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. And I have a cousin who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Doctor: I see. Thank you for sharing that information with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I'm going to diagnose you with major depressive disorder. 

Patient: (sighs) Okay. What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you're experiencing a persistent low mood and loss of interest in things you used to enjoy. You're also experiencing physical symptoms like fatigue and headaches, and you've had thoughts of hurting yourself. Depression is a medical condition, just like diabetes or high blood pressure, and it's nothing to be ashamed of.

Patient: (nods) Okay. So what do we do now?

Doctor: I'm going to recommend that you start therapy with a mental health professional. They can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies. I'll also prescribe medication to help manage your symptoms. And I want you to come back and see me in a week so we can check in and make sure you're doing okay.

Patient: (smiles weakly) Okay. Thank you, doctor.
