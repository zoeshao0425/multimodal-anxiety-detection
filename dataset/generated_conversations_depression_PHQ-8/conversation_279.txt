Doctor: Can you tell me about any feelings of sadness, hopelessness or worthlessness that you've been experiencing?

Patient: Yes, I've been feeling really down for the past few weeks. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything I do is pointless.

Doctor: How often have you been feeling this way? 

Patient: Almost every day. It's hard to shake off these feelings.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: My appetite has decreased, and I struggle to fall asleep at night. I also wake up several times during the night.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I don't feel like doing anything. It's like nothing brings me joy anymore.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or shame?

Patient: Yes, I feel guilty about not being able to function normally. I also feel ashamed that I can't seem to snap out of it.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I've had thoughts of ending my life. I know it's not right, but sometimes it feels like the only way out.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a bit about your personal background? Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant life changes recently?

Patient: I lost my job a few months ago, and since then, things have been tough financially. I also lost my mother to cancer last year, and that's been really hard to deal with.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to recommend some treatment options for you, including therapy and medication. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
