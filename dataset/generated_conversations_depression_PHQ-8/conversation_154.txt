Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: My appetite has decreased, and I've lost a few pounds.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking energy?

Patient: Yeah, I feel exhausted all the time, even when I haven't done anything.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?
