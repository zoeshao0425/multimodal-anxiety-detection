Doctor: So, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I just don't have any energy and I'm not interested in doing anything.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe that feeling of being down? Is it a constant feeling or does it come and go?

Patient: It's pretty constant. I wake up feeling sad and I just can't shake it throughout the day.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns? Are you sleeping more or less than usual?

Patient: I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. I just don't have the energy to get up in the morning.

Doctor: And how about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes there?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual. Food just doesn't seem appealing to me anymore.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like nothing I do matters and that I'm just a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicidal ideation?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I've been thinking a lot about just ending it all.

Doctor: I'm glad you shared that with me. It's important that we address those thoughts and get you the help you need. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Do you have a support system in place?

Patient: Not really. I've been feeling really isolated lately and I don't really have anyone to talk to.

Doctor: I see. Well, we're going to work together to get you feeling better. Based on what you've shared with me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'm going to recommend some treatment options for you, including therapy and medication. We'll also work on building up your support system so you have people to talk to and lean on during this difficult time. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.
