Doctor: Can you tell me about some of the symptoms you've been experiencing lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down and hopeless. I don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it's not getting any better.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I have trouble falling asleep at night, and then I wake up early in the morning feeling exhausted.

Doctor: Do you have any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Definitely. I used to be able to focus on my work, but now I can't seem to get anything done. I'm always second-guessing myself and worrying about everything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been eating much lately, and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me. I'm always apologizing for things that aren't even my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't think I would actually do anything, but the thoughts are there.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to refer you to a mental health specialist who can provide you with more support and treatment options. 

Patient: Okay, thank you. I'm glad I came in today.
