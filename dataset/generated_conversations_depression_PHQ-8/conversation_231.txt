Doctor: So, I understand you've been feeling down lately. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?

Patient: Yes, I've been feeling really sad and hopeless. It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or having trouble sleeping?

Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite. I used to love food, but now I don't feel like eating at all.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I feel like I'm a burden to everyone around me. I'm not doing anything right and I'm just a failure.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: (hesitates) Yes, I have. Sometimes I feel like it would be better if I wasn't here anymore.

Doctor: That's concerning. Have you talked to anyone about these thoughts?

Patient: No, I haven't. I didn't want to worry anyone.

Doctor: It's important that we address these thoughts. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, my job has been really stressful and I'm having trouble keeping up with everything. My relationship with my partner is also strained and we've been fighting a lot.

Doctor: It sounds like you have a lot going on. How have these stressors been affecting your daily functioning?

Patient: I've been skipping meals and not taking care of myself. I've been calling out of work and avoiding my responsibilities.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it seems like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health professional for further evaluation and treatment.

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid you were going to say that.

Doctor: It's important that we address your symptoms and get you the help you need. Depression is a common and treatable condition.

Patient: Okay, thank you for listening to me and taking me seriously.

Doctor: Of course. We'll work together to get you feeling better.
