Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: Honestly, it's been a few months now. I just can't seem to get out of this funk.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping at night and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: Have you experienced any loss of interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with my friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it. I don't have the energy for it anymore.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't know what to do about it.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, all the time. I just feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I'm having trouble focusing at work. It's like my mind is always wandering.
