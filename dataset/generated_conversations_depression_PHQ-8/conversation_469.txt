Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad. I don't have any energy, and I don't enjoy doing things that I used to love.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I haven't really been hungry lately, and I've lost some weight without meaning to.

Doctor: Do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a hard time focusing on things, and I feel like my brain is foggy.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like nothing I do matters and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting anyone, but sometimes I do wonder if things would be better if I wasn't around.

Doctor: Have you experienced any traumatic events in your life that might be contributing to how you're feeling now?

Patient: Well, my dad passed away a few months ago, and that's been really hard on me. But even before that, I was feeling pretty down.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. We can also talk about medication options if you're interested. Does that sound okay to you?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for listening to me.
