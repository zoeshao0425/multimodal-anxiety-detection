Doctor: So, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty down. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I just don't have much energy throughout the day.

Doctor: Okay, have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've noticed that I haven't been eating as much as I used to. I've lost a few pounds over the past few weeks.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been having trouble falling asleep at night and then I end up sleeping in late in the morning. But even after all that sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling like I'm not good enough and like I'm a burden on those around me.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Definitely. It's been hard to focus on anything and I've been putting off making decisions because it just feels overwhelming.

Doctor: Have you been having thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: I have, actually. I've been feeling pretty hopeless and like things will never get better.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced depression before?

Patient: Yeah, I've had episodes of depression in the past. I also have a family history of depression.

Doctor: That's good to know. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing major depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health specialist who can help you manage your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help. 

Doctor: Of course. Remember that depression is a treatable illness and you don't have to go through this alone.
