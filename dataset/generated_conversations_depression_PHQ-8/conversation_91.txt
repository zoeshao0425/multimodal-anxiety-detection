Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down for a while.

Doctor: Can you tell me a bit more about that? Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like everything is pointless and there's no joy in anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, my sleep has been really messed up. I have trouble falling asleep and then I wake up multiple times throughout the night. And I haven't been eating much lately either.

Doctor: Okay, and have you been feeling tired or fatigued during the day?

Patient: Yeah, all the time. Even if I get a decent amount of sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been having any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything. I feel like my brain is foggy and I can't think straight.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't think I would actually do anything, but the thoughts are there.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to know that depression is a medical condition and it's not your fault. We can work together to come up with a treatment plan that will help you feel better.
