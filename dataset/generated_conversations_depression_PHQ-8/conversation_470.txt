Doctor: Hi, can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in today?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. Like, really sad and hopeless.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe those feelings a little more? How often do you experience them?

Patient: It's pretty much constant. I wake up feeling sad and it doesn't really go away throughout the day. I just feel like there's no point to anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. And I don't really have much of an appetite anymore.

Doctor: Do you ever feel guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, all the time. I feel like I'm a burden on my family and friends.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I think about it. But I don't think I would actually do anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed a decrease in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything. Even simple decisions seem overwhelming.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, just a general feeling of being tired and run down.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. 

Patient: Really? I didn't think it was that serious.

Doctor: Depression is a very real and treatable condition. It's important that we address it so that you can start feeling better. 

Patient: Okay, what do we do next?

Doctor: I'd like to refer you to a mental health specialist who can provide you with counseling and possibly medication. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help manage your symptoms, like getting regular exercise, eating a healthy diet, and practicing relaxation techniques. 

Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help.
