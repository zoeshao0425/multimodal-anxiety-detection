Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: I've been feeling really down and sad for a while now.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? When did these feelings start?

Patient: It's hard to say exactly when it started, but I would say it's been going on for a few months now. I just feel like I don't enjoy anything anymore, and I'm always tired and have no energy.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual, and I've lost my appetite. I used to love food, but now I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I find it really hard to focus on anything and I'm always second-guessing myself. Even simple decisions are really difficult for me to make.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and I'm just a burden on everyone around me. I don't feel like I'm worth anything.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Sometimes I think about how much easier it would be if I wasn't here, but I don't think I would ever actually do anything.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or body aches?

Patient: Yeah, I've been getting headaches pretty frequently, and my body just feels heavy and tired all the time.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to do a more thorough assessment to get a better idea of how severe your symptoms are.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense. I just want to feel better.

Doctor: I understand, and we will work together to find the best treatment plan for you.
