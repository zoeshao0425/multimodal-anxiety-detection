Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, doctor, I've been feeling really down. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I used to love going out with friends and trying new things, but now it just feels like a chore.

Doctor: How about your sleep? Have you noticed any changes in your sleeping patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble falling asleep at night and then I wake up feeling tired and unmotivated.

Doctor: And what about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes in that?

Patient: I haven't really been hungry lately. I've been skipping meals and when I do eat, it's not very much.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything I do is wrong and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, doctor, I have. It's been really hard to deal with these feelings.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and ever since then, things have just been really tough. I've been struggling to find work and the bills are piling up.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. I think it's important that we address your symptoms and get you the help you need. Based on what you've told me, I believe you are experiencing depression.
