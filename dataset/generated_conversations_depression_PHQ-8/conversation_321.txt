Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down. Like, all the time. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I just feel like I don't have any energy. I've been having trouble sleeping, too. I'll either sleep too much or not enough.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't really been eating much. I don't really feel hungry, and when I do eat, it doesn't taste as good as it used to.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough. Like I'm not doing anything right. And I keep thinking about all the mistakes I've made in the past.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. Sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I wasn't here anymore.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for telling me that. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard for me to focus on anything. Even simple tasks seem overwhelming. And when I do try to make decisions, I just end up feeling even more confused.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomach aches?

Patient: No, not really. Just a general feeling of fatigue and heaviness.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on your answers, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I'm going to diagnose you with major depressive disorder. 

Patient: (sighs) Okay. What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you're experiencing a persistent low mood and loss of interest in activities that you used to enjoy. It's a serious condition, but it's also treatable. There are a number of different treatment options we can explore, like therapy, medication, or a combination of both.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. I just want to feel better.

Doctor: I understand. We'll work together to find the best treatment plan for you. And please remember, if you ever have thoughts of self-harm or suicide, it's important to reach out for help immediately. You can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at any time for support.
