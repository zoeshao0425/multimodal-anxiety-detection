Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yeah, I have been feeling really down lately. I don't have much energy and I'm having trouble sleeping.

Doctor: Ok, let's start with the first question from the PHQ-8 assessment. Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: Most days, honestly. It's been hard to shake this feeling.

Doctor: And how about feeling tired or having little energy?

Patient: That's definitely been a problem. I feel like I could sleep all day and still not feel rested.

Doctor: Alright, next question. How often have you had trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?

Patient: It's been a mix of both. Sometimes I can't fall asleep at all, but other times I sleep for hours and still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite lately. Food doesn't taste as good as it used to and I just don't feel hungry.

Doctor: I see. Have you been feeling bad about yourself, or that you're a failure or have let yourself or your family down?

Patient: Yeah, I've been really hard on myself lately. I feel like I'm not doing enough and that I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Next question - have you had any trouble concentrating on things like reading the newspaper or watching TV?

Patient: Definitely. I find myself zoning out a lot and not really paying attention to anything.

Doctor: And finally, have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or that you would be better off dead?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, actually. I've been having some dark thoughts lately and it's been really scary.

Doctor: Thank you for answering these questions honestly. Based on your responses, it seems like you are experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to explore some treatment options with you and refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings.

Patient: (sighs) Thank you, doctor. It's been really hard to admit that something is wrong, but I know I need help.

Doctor: You're not alone in this. Depression is a common condition and there are many effective treatments available. We'll work together to find the best approach for you.
