Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yeah, I guess you could say that. I've been feeling really down and hopeless lately.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or eating?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep at night or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And I haven't had much of an appetite lately either.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy level or motivation?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired and unmotivated lately. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and even harder to get anything done during the day.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough. It's been really hard to shake those feelings.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having some pretty dark thoughts lately. I don't think I would ever act on them, but they're definitely there.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to do a full assessment to see how severe your symptoms are and to come up with a treatment plan.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you for listening to me.
