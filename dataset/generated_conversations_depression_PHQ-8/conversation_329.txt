Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately? 

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad for a while now. I don't have much energy, and I don't enjoy things that I used to like doing. 

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way? 

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought it was just stress from work, but it hasn't gone away. 

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns? 

Patient: Yes, I've been eating less than usual and having trouble sleeping. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. 

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness? 

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good at anything and that nothing will ever get better. 

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicidal ideation? 

Patient: No, not really. But sometimes I do feel like it would be easier if I wasn't around. 

Doctor: Have you had any past experiences with depression or mental health issues? 

Patient: Yeah, my mom has struggled with depression for most of her life, and I've had some issues with anxiety in the past. 

Doctor: Based on your symptoms and history, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to do a more thorough evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options. 

Patient: Okay, that sounds good to me.
