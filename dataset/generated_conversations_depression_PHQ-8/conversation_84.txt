Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Based on what you've told me, I believe you may be suffering from depression. It's important to understand that depression is a medical condition and not a personal weakness. It can affect anyone at any stage of life.

Doctor: There's no need to feel ashamed. Depression is a common condition and there are effective treatments available. We can work together to develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs. 

Patient: That sounds good. I'm willing to try anything to feel better.

Doctor: Great. I'm going to refer you to a mental health specialist who can provide you with additional support and resources. In the meantime, I recommend that you prioritize self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.

Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and support.
