Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe that feeling a little more? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been about a month now. I just feel really empty and hopeless. Like nothing matters anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. And my appetite has decreased. I don't really feel like eating much.

Doctor: Okay, have you experienced any loss of interest in things you normally enjoy doing?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I used to love going for walks and spending time with friends, but now I just don't have the energy for it.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, actually. I've been having these thoughts lately, and it's really scary.

Doctor: I'm glad you told me. We take those thoughts very seriously. Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. 

Patient: (sighs) That's what I was afraid of.

Doctor: Depression is a medical condition, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's important that we address it so that you can start feeling better. 

Patient: Okay, what can we do?

Doctor: I would like to refer you to a mental health professional who can provide you with counseling and support. Additionally, we can discuss medication options that may help alleviate your symptoms. 

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help.

Doctor: Of course. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work together to get you feeling better.
