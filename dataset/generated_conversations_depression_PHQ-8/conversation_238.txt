Doctor: Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really sad and down most of the time. It's hard for me to enjoy things that I used to find fun or interesting. I've also been having trouble sleeping and I feel tired all the time.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't had much of an appetite lately and I've lost some weight. I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault. I've been really hard on myself lately.

Doctor: Have you had trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I've been having trouble focusing at work and it takes me a long time to make even simple decisions.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more irritable or restless than usual?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I get really easily frustrated and I feel like I'm constantly on edge.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I have. Sometimes I feel like things would be better if I wasn't around.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I've been going through a lot of stress at work and I recently went through a breakup. It's been really hard to deal with everything.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'd like to talk to you more about treatment options.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. I really want to start feeling better.
