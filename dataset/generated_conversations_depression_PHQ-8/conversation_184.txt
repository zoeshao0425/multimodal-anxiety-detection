Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Can you describe that feeling a little more? Do you feel sad or hopeless?

Patient: Definitely sad. It's like everything just feels pointless and I can't shake the feeling.

Doctor: How often have you been feeling this way?

Patient: Pretty much every day for the past few weeks.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: Okay, and have you been experiencing any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really. It's mostly just the emotional stuff.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life lately? Have you experienced any major stressors or life changes?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and I've been having trouble finding a new one. That's been really stressful for me.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden my friends and family with my problems.

Doctor: I understand, but it's important to reach out for help when you need it. Have you considered seeing a therapist or counselor?

Patient: Yeah, I've thought about it. But I'm not sure if it would really help.

Doctor: Well, therapy can be a really helpful tool for managing depression. I'd strongly recommend giving it a try. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing moderate to severe depression. I'd like to officially diagnose you with depression and discuss treatment options with you.

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help. I appreciate it.
