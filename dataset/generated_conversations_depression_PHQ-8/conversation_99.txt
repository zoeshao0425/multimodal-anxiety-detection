Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: I've been feeling really down and hopeless. I don't have any motivation to do anything, and I'm always tired.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. Sometimes I can barely get out of bed in the morning.

Doctor: How about your appetite? Have you had any changes there?

Patient: I haven't been eating as much as I used to. Food doesn't really interest me anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, all the time. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything I do is wrong.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Definitely. I used to love playing video games and hanging out with my friends, but now I just don't care about those things anymore.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, sometimes I do. I don't know what to do about it.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and I haven't been able to find anything since then. My girlfriend broke up with me around the same time, and I just feel like everything's falling apart.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time right now. Based on what you've told me, I think you might be experiencing depression. 

Patient: (sighs) I was afraid you were going to say that.

Doctor: Depression is a medical condition, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. We can work together to come up with a treatment plan that will help you feel better. 

Patient: Okay, I'm willing to try anything at this point.

Doctor: That's great to hear. I'm going to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through some of the things you're going through, and I'm also going to prescribe an antidepressant medication. It may take a few weeks for the medication to start working, but in the meantime, it's important that you take care of yourself. Try to get some exercise, eat healthy foods, and get plenty of rest.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help.
