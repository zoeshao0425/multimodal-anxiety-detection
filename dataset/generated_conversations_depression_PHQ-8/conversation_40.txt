Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and sad most of the time.

Doctor: Can you tell me a bit more about that? Have you been feeling hopeless or helpless?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like everything is pointless and there's no way out of this feeling.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: My appetite has been all over the place, sometimes I don't feel like eating at all and other times I eat everything in sight. And my sleep has been really disrupted, I have trouble falling asleep and then wake up multiple times during the night.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things that you used to enjoy doing?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends or watching movies, but now I just don't feel like doing anything. It all seems like too much effort.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yeah, I'm exhausted all the time, even after a full night's sleep. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of being drained.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (hesitates) Yeah, I have. Sometimes it just feels like the only way to escape this constant sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. We can work together to come up with a treatment plan that will help you feel better.
