Doctor: Thank you for answering these questions. Based on your answers, it seems like you are experiencing symptoms of depression. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, my job has been really stressful lately, and I feel like I'm not performing well. My relationship with my partner has also been strained, and we've been arguing a lot lately. I also lost my grandfather a few weeks ago, and it's been really hard for me to cope with his loss.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot of stressors lately, which can contribute to depression. I would like to recommend that you speak with a therapist or counselor to help you manage your symptoms and work through any underlying issues. In the meantime, I can prescribe medication to help alleviate some of your symptoms.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
