Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on. How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down. Like, all the time. Nothing seems to make me happy anymore.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any physical symptoms, like changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I've been sleeping a lot more than usual, and I don't really feel hungry most of the time.

Doctor: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really tired and unmotivated all the time. I used to be really active and outgoing, but now I just don't have the energy for anything.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like nothing I do matters and I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or anyone else?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay. And how long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: Probably a few months now. It's been getting worse and worse.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently?

Patient: Not really. Everything's been pretty normal, I guess.

Doctor: Alright. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to do a full assessment to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options with you.

Patient: Okay, yeah. That makes sense.
