Doctor: So, I understand that you're here today to discuss your mental health. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I just don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe that feeling a bit more? Do you feel sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like everything is pointless and I can't get excited about anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. And I've also noticed that I'm not as hungry as I used to be.

Doctor: Okay, and how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: I'd say it's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a lot of trouble with that lately. It's hard to focus on anything and I feel like my memory is getting worse.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really down all the time.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a better sense of how severe your symptoms are.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems: little interest or pleasure in doing things, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, trouble falling or staying asleep, feeling tired or having little energy, poor appetite or overeating, feeling bad about yourself, feeling like you're a failure or have let yourself or your family down, trouble concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper or watching television, moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed, or the opposite - being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual?

Patient: I would say most of those things have been bothering me at least half the time.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, I would diagnose you with depression. It's important to know that depression is a treatable condition, and there are many options available to help you feel better. Would you be interested in discussing some treatment options?
