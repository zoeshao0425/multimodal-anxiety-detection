Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling really down. It's like everything is just gray and I don't have the energy to do anything.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I wake up a lot during the night and I have trouble falling asleep.

Doctor: How about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes there?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't really been hungry lately. I used to love eating but now nothing really appeals to me.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more tired than usual?

Patient: Definitely. I feel exhausted all the time, even if I haven't done anything all day.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's like my brain is foggy all the time. I can't focus on anything and even small decisions seem overwhelming.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down. I feel like I'm not worth anything.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel like it would be better if I wasn't here. But I know that's not right.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you've told me, I believe you may be experiencing depression. 

Patient: Really? I didn't think it was that serious.

Doctor: Depression is a very serious condition that can have a big impact on your daily life. But the good news is that it's treatable. We can work together to come up with a treatment plan that works for you.

Patient: That sounds good. I'm just relieved to know that there's a name for what I'm feeling and that it's not just me being lazy or something.

Doctor: Absolutely. Depression is a real medical condition and it's nothing to be ashamed of. The most important thing is that we get you the help you need.
