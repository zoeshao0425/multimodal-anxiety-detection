Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. And I've lost my appetite too. I just don't feel hungry.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm just a burden on everyone around me. I can't seem to do anything right.

Doctor: Do you ever have thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Sometimes, yeah. I don't think I would actually do anything, but the thoughts are there.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, no. It's mostly just the emotional stuff.

Doctor: Have you experienced any traumatic events recently, like the loss of a loved one or a major life change?
