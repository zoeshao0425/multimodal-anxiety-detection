Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately. Have you been feeling down or sad?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about how long you've been feeling this way?

Patient: I think it's been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought it was just stress from work, but it hasn't gone away.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: My appetite has definitely decreased. I used to love eating, but now I just don't feel hungry. And I've been having trouble sleeping too. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things that used to bring you joy or pleasure?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing video games and hanging out with friends, but now I just don't feel like doing anything. Even when I do try to do those things, I just don't enjoy them anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more tired or fatigued than usual?

Patient: Definitely. Even when I do manage to get some sleep, I still feel exhausted throughout the day.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty hopeless lately. Like nothing is ever going to get better. And I've been feeling like I'm not good enough at anything.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering these questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to discuss treatment options with you and possibly refer you to a therapist.
