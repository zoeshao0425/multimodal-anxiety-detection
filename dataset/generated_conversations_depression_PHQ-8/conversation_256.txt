Doctor: So, I understand that you have been feeling down lately. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very sad and hopeless. I don't enjoy doing things that I used to love, like going out with friends or watching movies. I also feel very tired all the time and have trouble sleeping at night.

Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. I've tried to ignore it, but it's just getting worse.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?

Patient: Yes, I've lost my appetite. I used to love eating, but now I just don't feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: Do you ever feel guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I do. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, I have. It's like the only way to end the pain is to end my life.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about your personal life? Are you married or in a relationship?

Patient: No, I'm single. I recently went through a breakup, which has made everything worse.

Doctor: I see. Have you talked to anyone about your feelings?

Patient: No, I haven't. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: It's important to talk to someone about how you're feeling. Have you considered seeing a therapist or counselor?

Patient: I haven't, but I'm willing to try anything to feel better.

Doctor: That's a good attitude to have. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to prescribe you some medication and refer you to a therapist who can help you work through your feelings.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
