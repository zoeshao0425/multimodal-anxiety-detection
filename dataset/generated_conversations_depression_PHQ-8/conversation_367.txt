Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Do you ever feel guilty or worthless?

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: Sometimes I think about it, but I know I would never actually do it.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?
