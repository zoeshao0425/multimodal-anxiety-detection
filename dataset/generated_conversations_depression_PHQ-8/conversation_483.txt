Doctor: Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: Yeah, I've struggled with it on and off for years. But this feels different somehow. Like it's harder to shake off than before.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to run some tests and do a full evaluation to confirm the diagnosis, but I think it's important that we start exploring treatment options as soon as possible. Would you be open to that?

Patient: Yes, absolutely. I really want to start feeling better again.
