Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about how long you've been feeling this way?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and I've lost some weight.

Patient: Yeah, I've noticed that I'm having a hard time focusing at work and it's been harder to make decisions.

Doctor: Have you felt tired or low energy?
