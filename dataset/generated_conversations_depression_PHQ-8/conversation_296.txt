Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately. Have you been feeling down or depressed?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really low for the past few weeks. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: How often have you been feeling this way? Is it every day or just some days?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. I wake up feeling sad and it lasts throughout the day.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And my appetite has decreased. I don't feel like eating much.

Doctor: Have you lost any weight recently?

Patient: Yes, I have. About 5 pounds in the past month.

Doctor: Do you ever feel guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, all the time. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, I have. I've been having these thoughts for a while now.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any physical symptoms such as headaches or body aches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Do you have any family history of depression or other mental health conditions?

Patient: Yes, my mother has struggled with depression for years.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. In the meantime, please know that you are not alone and there is support available to you.
