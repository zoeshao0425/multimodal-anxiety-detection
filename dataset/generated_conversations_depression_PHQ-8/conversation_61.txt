Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I’ve been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? When did it start?

Patient: It’s been going on for a few weeks now. I just feel really sad all the time, and I don’t have any energy. I used to love going out with friends or doing things I enjoyed, but now I don’t even want to get out of bed.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual. And I don’t really have much of an appetite anymore. Food just doesn’t seem appealing to me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Honestly, yeah. Sometimes I feel like life isn’t worth living anymore.

Doctor: Okay, that’s really important to know. Are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?

Patient: I’ve also been feeling really guilty and worthless. Like I’m a burden to everyone around me.

Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or muscle pain?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I’d like to ask you a few more questions to get a better sense of how severe it is.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Have you had trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. It’s hard to focus on anything when I’m feeling so low.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, absolutely. I used to love playing music, but now I can’t even bring myself to pick up my guitar.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking energy?

Patient: Yes, all the time. Even when I’ve slept for hours, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been feeling restless or agitated?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you’re experiencing moderate to severe symptoms of depression. I’d like to recommend a few treatment options to help you start feeling better.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: First of all, I’d like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through some of the underlying issues that may be contributing to your depression. Additionally, I’d like to prescribe an antidepressant medication that can help alleviate some of your symptoms. We’ll need to monitor you closely to make sure it’s working effectively and adjust the dosage if necessary.

Patient: Okay, I’m willing to try anything at this point.

Doctor: Great. It’s important to remember that depression is a treatable illness, and with the right support and treatment, you can start feeling better soon.
