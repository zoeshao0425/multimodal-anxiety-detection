Doctor: So, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, doctor, I haven't been feeling like myself. I've been feeling really down and sad all the time.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about that? How often do you feel that way?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. I wake up feeling sad, and it doesn't really go away throughout the day.

Doctor: I see. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't really been eating much lately, and I've been having trouble sleeping. I'll either have trouble falling asleep or I'll wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time. Even when I get a good night's sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Alright, and have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Do you ever have thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I have. I've been having thoughts of ending my life because I just feel so hopeless.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, I haven't really had any physical symptoms.

Doctor: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble focusing on anything and making decisions has been really difficult for me.

Doctor: Alright. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to diagnose you with depression and discuss treatment options with you.
