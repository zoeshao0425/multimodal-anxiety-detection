Doctor: So, I understand that you've been feeling down lately. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad all the time. It's like there's this weight on my chest that won't go away.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: About two months now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I wake up a lot during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep.

Doctor: Okay. And how about your appetite? Have you been eating more or less than usual?

Patient: I haven't been eating much at all, really. I just don't feel hungry.

Doctor: Have you lost weight as a result?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost about 10 pounds.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really tired all the time. Even when I do manage to get some sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me. Like I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't know what to do anymore.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to run some tests to confirm this diagnosis.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: In the meantime, I want you to know that you're not alone. Depression is a common condition, and there are treatments available that can help you feel better. We'll work together to come up with a plan that's right for you.
