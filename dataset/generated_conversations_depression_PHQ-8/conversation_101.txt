Doctor: Can you tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad most of the time. I don't have much energy, and I'm not interested in doing things that I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: How about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes there?

Patient: I haven't been eating as much as usual. I just don't feel hungry, and food doesn't taste as good as it used to.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm a burden on my family and friends. I also feel guilty for not being able to do things that I used to be able to do.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I have. Sometimes I feel like life isn't worth living and that everyone would be better off without me.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, such as headaches or stomach problems?

Patient: I've been having headaches and stomachaches, but I think that's just because I'm so stressed out all the time.

Doctor: Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and I haven't been able to find another one. My relationship with my partner has been rocky, and we're considering breaking up. I also lost a close friend to cancer last year, and I haven't been able to fully process that yet.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I'm going to recommend that you see a therapist and potentially start medication to help manage your symptoms. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
