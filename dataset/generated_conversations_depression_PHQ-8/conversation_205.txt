Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad. It's like I don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. At first, I thought it was just a phase, but it hasn't gone away.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yes, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual, and I've lost my appetite. I used to love eating, but now food doesn't seem appealing at all.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything I do is wrong. I keep thinking about past mistakes and regretting them.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: I haven't had any specific plans, but sometimes I do think about how much easier it would be if I wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Do you have any history of depression or other mental health issues in your family?

Patient: Yes, my mom has struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. She's been on medication for it for years.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes or stressors recently?

Patient: Not really, things have been pretty stable in my life. But I do feel like I'm stuck in a rut and don't know how to get out of it.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to do some further assessments and discuss treatment options with you. 

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. I just want to feel like myself again.
