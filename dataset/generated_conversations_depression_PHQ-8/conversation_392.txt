Doctor: So, tell me, what brings you here today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really irritable and moody lately. I've also lost interest in things that used to make me happy, like spending time with my friends and family.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, such as changes in appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. And I've lost my appetite too. I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really hopeless and helpless.

Doctor: Have you experienced any traumatic events or significant life changes recently?

Patient: Well, my grandmother passed away a few months ago, and that was really hard for me. And I've been having some problems at work, which has been stressful.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: Yeah, I had a bout of depression a few years ago. But it wasn't this bad.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression again. I'd like to do a PHQ-8 assessment to get a better idea of how severe your symptoms are.

Patient: Okay, sure.

Doctor: (conducts PHQ-8 assessment)

Doctor: Based on your answers, it looks like you're experiencing moderate to severe depression. I'd like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies. And I'd also like to prescribe you an antidepressant to help alleviate your symptoms.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate your help.
