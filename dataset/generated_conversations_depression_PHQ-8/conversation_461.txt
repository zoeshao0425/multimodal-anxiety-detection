Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I’ve been feeling really down lately. I just can’t seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about how you’re feeling?

Patient: Well, I don’t have much energy or motivation to do anything. I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual and I’m not enjoying things that I used to. I feel like I’m just going through the motions of my daily routine without any real purpose.

Doctor: Are you experiencing any physical symptoms, such as changes in appetite or weight?

Patient: Yes, I’ve noticed that I’ve been eating more than usual and have gained some weight. I also feel tired all the time, even after getting a full night’s sleep.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven’t had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: That’s good to hear. Have you experienced any significant life events recently, such as a loss or major change?

Patient: Actually, yes. My grandmother passed away a few months ago and it’s been really hard for me to cope with her loss.

Doctor: I see. It’s common for people to experience depression after a significant loss. Have you ever experienced these symptoms before?

Patient: Not to this extent. I’ve felt sad before, but never for this long or with these physical symptoms.

Doctor: Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I’d like to ask you a few more questions to better understand your condition.
