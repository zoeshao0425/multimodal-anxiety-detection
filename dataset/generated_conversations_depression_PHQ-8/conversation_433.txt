Doctor: So, can you tell me how you've been feeling lately? Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling really down lately. I don't have much energy, and I'm not enjoying things that I used to love doing.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about your lack of energy? Do you feel tired all the time, or is it more of a lack of motivation?

Patient: It's more of a lack of motivation. I just don't feel like doing anything. I used to enjoy going for walks or meeting up with friends, but now I can't even bring myself to get out of bed most days.

Doctor: And how about your sleep? Have you noticed any changes there?

Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep at night, or I wake up several times during the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your appetite?

Patient: Yes, I've been eating a lot less than usual. I just don't have much of an appetite these days.

Doctor: And have you been feeling more irritable or easily angered than usual?

Patient: Yes, actually. I find myself getting frustrated over little things that normally wouldn't bother me.

Doctor: Okay, and have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting myself, but I do feel like my life isn't worth living sometimes.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any significant life events or stressors recently that may have triggered these symptoms?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and I haven't been able to find a new one yet. That's been really stressful and has made me feel pretty hopeless.

Doctor: I see. And have you ever experienced symptoms like these before?

Patient: Yes, I have struggled with depression in the past. It runs in my family, and I've had a few episodes of depression over the years.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing another episode of depression. I'm going to diagnose you with major depressive disorder. We can discuss treatment options, but first, I'd like to ask you a few more questions to get a better sense of how severe your symptoms are.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.
