Doctor: So, how have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? Have you been feeling sad or empty most of the day, nearly every day?

Patient: Yes, I have. It's like a cloud just follows me around all the time.

Doctor: And have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy, like hobbies or spending time with friends?

Patient: Definitely. I used to love playing basketball with my friends, but now I just don't feel like it anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less lately. I just don't have much of an appetite.

Doctor: How about your sleep? Have you been sleeping too much or too little?

Patient: I've been having trouble sleeping, actually. I usually wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a lot of trouble with that. It's like my mind just won't focus on anything.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting anyone else, but I have thought about hurting myself.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and I've been having trouble finding a new one. My girlfriend also broke up with me recently, which has been really hard.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to refer you to a mental health specialist who can work with you to develop a treatment plan. Does that sound okay to you?

Patient: Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.
