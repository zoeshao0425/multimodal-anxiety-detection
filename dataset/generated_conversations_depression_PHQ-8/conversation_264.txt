Doctor: So, how have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and sad most of the time.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about how you feel? For example, do you feel hopeless or helpless?

Patient: Yeah, I do. I feel like nothing is going right for me and that things won't get better. I also feel like I can't do anything to change my situation.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have trouble sleeping. I often toss and turn at night and wake up feeling exhausted.

Doctor: How about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes in your eating habits?

Patient: I haven't been eating as much as I used to. Sometimes I forget to eat altogether or just don't feel hungry.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more tired than usual?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I feel like I could sleep all day and still not feel rested.

Doctor: Do you ever feel restless or have trouble sitting still?

Patient: No, not really. I mostly just feel really tired and unmotivated.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't. I just feel really down and hopeless most of the time.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health professional who can help you manage these symptoms and improve your overall quality of life. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That sounds like a good idea.
