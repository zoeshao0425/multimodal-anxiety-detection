Doctor: So, I understand you've been feeling down lately. Can you tell me a bit more about your symptoms?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad all the time. It's like I can't shake this feeling of hopelessness.

Doctor: I see. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like changes in appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yes, actually. I've been having trouble sleeping at night, and I've lost my appetite recently.

Doctor: Okay. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: And have you noticed any triggers for these feelings? Anything that seems to make them worse?

Patient: Not really. It just feels like everything is overwhelming and I can't seem to find joy in anything anymore.

Doctor: Alright. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay, good. Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: Yeah, I've struggled with it on and off for a while now.

Doctor: I see. And have you been taking any medication or receiving any treatment for it?

Patient: I was seeing a therapist for a while, but I haven't been going recently.
