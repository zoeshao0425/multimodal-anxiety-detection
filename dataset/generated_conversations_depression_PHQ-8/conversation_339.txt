Doctor: So, let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any of the following symptoms in the past two weeks? 

Patient: Okay, sure. What are the symptoms?

Doctor: Well, there are eight common symptoms of depression that we use to assess the severity of the condition. They are: feeling down, depressed, or hopeless; little interest or pleasure in doing things; trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much; feeling tired or having little energy; poor appetite or overeating; feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down; trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television; and moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed.

Patient: Oh, I see. Yes, I've been feeling down and hopeless for a while now. I don't really enjoy doing things anymore, even things I used to love. I have trouble falling asleep at night, and I'm always tired during the day. My appetite has decreased, and I don't feel like eating much. I also feel like I'm a failure and that I've let my family down. I have trouble concentrating on work, and I feel like I'm moving and speaking slower than usual.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me more about how these symptoms are affecting your daily life?

Patient: Well, I'm having trouble getting out of bed in the morning. I don't feel motivated to do anything, and I just want to stay in bed all day. I'm having trouble keeping up with my work, and I'm making mistakes that I wouldn't normally make. I'm also avoiding social situations because I don't feel like being around people. All I want to do is be alone.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced depression before?

Patient: Yes, I have. I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago and was on medication for a while. I thought I had gotten better, but these symptoms have come back.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know that. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you are experiencing moderate to severe depression. I would like to recommend that you start taking medication again, and I can refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate your help.

Doctor: Of course. Just remember that depression is a treatable condition, and there is no shame in seeking help. We will work together to get you feeling better.
