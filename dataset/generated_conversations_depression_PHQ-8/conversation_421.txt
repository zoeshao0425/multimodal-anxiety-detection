Doctor: Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I don't have much energy throughout the day.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't had much of an appetite lately and I've been sleeping a lot more than usual.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or interest in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going for runs and spending time with friends, but lately I just don't have the energy or motivation to do those things anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless lately. Like nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any traumatic events or major life changes recently?

Patient: Not really. I've just been feeling really stressed out at work and in my personal life.

Doctor: Okay, based on your symptoms and experiences, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health professional who can provide you with more support and resources. Would you be open to that?

Patient: Yeah, I think that would be helpful. Thank you for your help.
