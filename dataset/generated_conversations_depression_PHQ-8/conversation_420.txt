Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about your mood over the past two weeks?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I just feel really sad all the time.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or helpless?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I just feel like things are never going to get better, and there's nothing I can do to change that.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing basketball with my friends, but now I just don't have the energy for it. I don't really enjoy anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've been eating a lot less than usual, and I've lost quite a bit of weight recently.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a really hard time falling asleep at night, and then I wake up really early and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you felt more tired than usual?

Patient: Definitely. I just feel exhausted all the time, even when I haven't done anything.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything lately. I can't seem to make even simple decisions without feeling overwhelmed.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: I haven't had any specific plans, but sometimes I just feel like it would be easier if I wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to do some further testing to confirm this, but in the meantime, I want you to know that there is help available. We can work together to find a treatment plan that works for you, and I'm here to support you every step of the way.
