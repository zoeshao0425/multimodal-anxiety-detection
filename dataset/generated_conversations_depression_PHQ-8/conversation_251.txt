Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling pretty down. I just don't have much energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I've lost my appetite for the most part.

Doctor: How often do you feel this way? Is it every day, or just some days?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. I just feel like I'm in a constant state of sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Definitely. I used to be really productive at work, but lately I've been having trouble focusing and making even simple decisions.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel like I'm in a really dark place right now.

Doctor: Have you experienced any traumatic events recently that may have triggered these feelings?

Patient: Not really. I've just been going through a lot of stress at work and in my personal life.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced symptoms like this before?

Patient: Yeah, I've struggled with depression on and off for most of my adult life.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing a depressive episode. I'd like to recommend some treatment options to help you feel better.

Patient: That would be great. I really want to get back to feeling like myself again.
