Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: I've been feeling really down, doctor. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing a lack of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I used to love going out with friends and trying new things, but now I just don't have the energy for it.

Doctor: Have you been feeling more tired than usual?

Patient: Yes, I'm exhausted all the time. Even after a full night's sleep, I still feel like I could just lay in bed all day.

Doctor: Do you find yourself having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, it's been really difficult to focus on anything. Even simple tasks like grocery shopping feel overwhelming.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've been eating a lot less than usual, and I've lost some weight as a result.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I feel like nothing I do matters and that I'm just a burden on the people around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: (hesitates) Yes, I have. It's been really hard to see a way out of this.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. This is a common and treatable condition, and I want to help you get the support you need.

Patient: (sighs) I'm relieved to hear that there might be something I can do. It's been really hard to live like this.

Doctor: I'm going to refer you to a mental health professional who can work with you to develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I want you to know that you're not alone, and that there are people who care about you.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. It means a lot to hear that.
