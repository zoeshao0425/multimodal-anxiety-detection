Doctor: So, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately that led you to seek medical attention?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. It's like I'm in this constant state of sadness or hopelessness. I don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: I see. Can you describe what it feels like when you're feeling sad or hopeless? 

Patient: It's hard to explain. It's like everything just feels heavy, and I don't feel like doing anything. I don't enjoy things that I used to love doing before. I feel like I'm just going through the motions.

Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yeah, I've noticed that I'm not as hungry as I used to be. Sometimes I even forget to eat. And I've lost some weight too.

Doctor: Have you experienced any trouble sleeping or changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I wake up multiple times during the night, and I don't feel rested in the morning.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or ability to concentrate?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I have no energy at all. Even simple tasks like getting out of bed or taking a shower feel like a chore. And I can't concentrate on anything for very long.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault. I feel like a burden to my family and friends. I don't feel like I'm good enough at anything.

Doctor: Okay. Finally, have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, I have. It's like sometimes I feel like it would be easier if I just wasn't here anymore.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Based on your answers, it seems like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to start you on a treatment plan that includes therapy and medication to help manage your symptoms.
