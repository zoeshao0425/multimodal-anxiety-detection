Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Well, I've been feeling pretty down. I don't really have much energy, and I'm not really interested in doing things that I used to enjoy.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling like this?

Patient: Probably for the past few weeks. It's been getting worse and worse.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't really been hungry, and I've had trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless. I feel like I'm not good enough and that nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, I have. I don't know if I would actually do anything, but the thought has crossed my mind.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Do you have a history of depression or mental illness in your family?

Patient: My mom has struggled with depression in the past, and I've had some issues with anxiety before. But nothing like this.

Doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. Have you experienced any major life changes recently that could be contributing to how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. Things have been pretty stable, but I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you might be experiencing depression. I'd like to do a more thorough assessment to confirm that diagnosis and figure out the best course of treatment for you.
