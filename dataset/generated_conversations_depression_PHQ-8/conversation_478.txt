Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately. Have you been feeling down or depressed?

Patient: Yeah, I have been feeling really low for the past few weeks.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe to me what that feels like? Are you experiencing any physical symptoms?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time and I don't have much energy. I'm also having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or emotions?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really sad and hopeless most of the time. I don't enjoy things that used to make me happy and I feel like I'm not worth anything.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: About three weeks now.

Doctor: Have you experienced any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently?

Patient: Not really, everything has been pretty normal.

Doctor: Okay, do you have a history of depression or any other mental health conditions?

Patient: Yeah, I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago and I've been on medication for it. But I stopped taking my medication a few months ago because I thought I was feeling better.

Doctor: I see. Well, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing a relapse of your depression. I'm going to diagnose you with major depressive disorder.

Patient: Okay, what does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you are experiencing symptoms of depression that are severe enough to interfere with your daily functioning. We can discuss treatment options, including medication and therapy, that can help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.
