Doctor: So, tell me about your current mood. Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down for the past few weeks. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay. Have you lost interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, actually. I used to love going to the gym and hanging out with my friends, but now I just don't have the energy or motivation to do those things.

Doctor: Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: My appetite has been all over the place. Some days I don't feel like eating anything, and other days I can't stop eating. I've also gained a few pounds recently.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: Both, actually. I have trouble falling asleep at night, but then I end up sleeping in really late in the morning.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yeah, I feel exhausted all the time. Even when I do manage to get some sleep, I still feel drained.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless lately. I just feel like I'm not good enough and that nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: (pauses) Yeah, actually. Sometimes I feel like things would be easier if I just wasn't around anymore.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'm going to recommend that we start you on a treatment plan that includes therapy and possibly medication. We'll work together to help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.
