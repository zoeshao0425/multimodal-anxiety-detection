Doctor: So, let's start by talking about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very down lately. I can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe this sadness? How often do you feel it and how intense is it?

Patient: It's a constant feeling of emptiness and hopelessness. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and can't find any joy in anything. It's there all the time, and it's pretty intense.

Doctor: I see. Do you have trouble sleeping or find yourself sleeping too much?

Patient: Yes, I have trouble sleeping. I lay awake for hours at night, and when I do finally fall asleep, I don't feel rested in the morning.

Doctor: Alright. Do you have any appetite changes? Are you eating more or less than usual?

Patient: I've lost my appetite. I used to love food, but now I just don't have any interest in it. I've lost weight because of it.

Doctor: Have you noticed a decrease in your energy levels? Are you feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yes, I'm always tired. Even when I get a good night's sleep, I still feel exhausted. It's hard to find the motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yes, I've been feeling extremely guilty. I feel like everything that goes wrong is my fault. I also feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm not living up to my potential.

Doctor: Okay. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I have. Sometimes I think about ending my life. I don't have any plans to do it, but the thoughts are there.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I'm going to diagnose you with major depressive disorder.

Patient: What does that mean?

Doctor: It means that you're experiencing a persistent and intense feeling of sadness that's impacting your daily functioning. Depression is a serious condition, but it's treatable. There are different treatment options available, including therapy and medication. We can work together to find the best course of treatment for you.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
