Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating less and having trouble sleeping at night.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing hobbies, but now I just don't feel like it.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything and I feel like I can't make even simple decisions.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like fatigue or aches?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time and my body feels heavy and achy.

Doctor: Based on your symptoms, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop coping strategies. Additionally, I would like to prescribe medication to help alleviate some of your symptoms. Does that sound okay to you?

Patient: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me.
