Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling really down and sad for the past few weeks. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I've lost interest in things that used to make me happy.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping at night and I've lost my appetite. I've also lost weight recently.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued during the day?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time. Even small tasks feel like a huge effort.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless? Do you have negative thoughts about yourself?

Patient: Yes, I feel like I'm not good enough and that nothing I do matters. I feel like a burden to others and that I'm not contributing anything to society.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, it's been hard to focus on anything. Even simple decisions feel overwhelming.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I've had thoughts of ending my life. I don't see any way out of this darkness and it feels like the only option.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find work. Money is tight and I'm worried about paying my bills. On top of that, my relationship with my partner has been strained lately.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors. Based on what you've told me, it seems like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to do a full assessment to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options with you.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. I just want to feel better again.

Doctor: I understand. We'll work together to come up with a plan that works for you.
