Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have any motivation to do anything and I'm always tired.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about that? When did you start feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. I just feel like I can't get out of bed in the morning and I don't enjoy doing things I used to love.

Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less and I have trouble falling asleep at night.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your mood or feelings of worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really hopeless and worthless. I don't feel like I'm good at anything and I just feel like a burden to everyone around me.

Doctor: I understand. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having those thoughts lately. I don't think I would ever act on them, but they're always in the back of my mind.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating or physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble concentrating and I get headaches pretty frequently.

Doctor: Okay, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I want to do a more thorough assessment to confirm this diagnosis.
