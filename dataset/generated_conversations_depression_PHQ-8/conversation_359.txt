Doctor: Can you tell me how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad. It's been hard for me to find joy in things that I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite and have lost some weight as a result.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been struggling to fall asleep at night and then end up sleeping in late in the morning.

Doctor: Have you noticed a lack of energy or motivation to do things?

Patient: Yes, it's been really hard for me to get out of bed and do anything productive. I just feel so drained all the time.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: I have had thoughts of wanting to escape the pain, but I haven't acted on them.

Doctor: Thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background and what may have triggered these feelings?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and have been struggling to find work. I also recently went through a breakup, which has been really difficult for me to cope with.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a mental health specialist who can help you manage these feelings and develop a treatment plan.

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help.
