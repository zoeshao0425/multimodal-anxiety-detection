Doctor: So, let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling really down lately. I don't have much energy, and I feel sad most of the time.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just don't feel like myself anymore. I used to be really outgoing and happy, but now I just feel like I'm in a fog.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or eating?

Patient: Yeah, my sleep has been really messed up lately. I have trouble falling asleep, and then I wake up really early and can't get back to sleep. And I haven't had much of an appetite either.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it. I don't really enjoy anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I just feel like nothing is ever going to get better and that I'm not worth anything.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting anyone else, but I have thought about hurting myself.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating or feeling tired all the time?

Patient: Yes, I have trouble concentrating on anything, and I feel tired all the time no matter how much sleep I get.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms of depression. I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through your feelings and start feeling better. We can also discuss medication options if you feel that would be helpful.
