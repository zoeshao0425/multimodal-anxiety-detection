Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: Yes, I have. I've been feeling like there's no point in living anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yes, I have. Even when I get enough sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Definitely. I feel like my mind is foggy all the time, and I can't focus on anything.
