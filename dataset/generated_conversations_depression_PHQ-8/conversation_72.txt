Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How often do you feel that way?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. I wake up feeling sad and it just doesn't go away.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite and I've lost some weight as a result.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or do you sleep too much?

Patient: I have trouble sleeping. I usually wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed a lack of energy or motivation to do things?

Patient: Definitely. I used to love going for walks and doing things with friends, but now I just don't have the energy for it.

Doctor: Do you ever feel guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, all the time. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: (pauses) Yes, I have.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find work since then. My relationship with my partner has also been rocky and we've been fighting a lot.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. Based on what you've told me, I think you may be experiencing depression.

Patient: Really? I didn't think it was that serious.

Doctor: Depression is a common and treatable condition. I want to help you get better. We can discuss treatment options and what would work best for you.

Patient: Thank you, that means a lot. I really want to feel better.
