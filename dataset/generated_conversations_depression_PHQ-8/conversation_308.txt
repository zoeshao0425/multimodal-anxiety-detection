Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and unmotivated for the past few weeks.

Doctor: Can you describe your mood in more detail? Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I've been feeling really sad and hopeless lately. It's like everything feels pointless and I can't seem to shake it off.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been sleeping well at all. I usually wake up several times throughout the night and have trouble falling back asleep. And my appetite has been really low too. I just don't feel hungry most of the time.

Doctor: Have you experienced any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, that's been a big one for me. I used to love going out with friends or doing things around the house, but now I just don't feel like doing anything at all.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking in energy?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I feel exhausted all the time, even if I haven't done much during the day.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that. I just feel really low and hopeless.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms such as headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really. It's mostly just been the emotional stuff.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options and help you get back on track.
