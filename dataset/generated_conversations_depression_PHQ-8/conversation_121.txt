Doctor: Hi, can you tell me how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: I've been feeling really down and sad. I don't have much motivation to do anything, and I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms besides feeling sad?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. I also have no appetite and have lost weight.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced these symptoms before?

Patient: Yeah, I went through a tough time a few years ago and had similar symptoms, but they went away after a while.

Doctor: Have you noticed any triggers or events that may have caused your current symptoms?

Patient: Not really. Nothing significant has happened recently that would explain why I feel this way.

Doctor: Do you ever have thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, I don't have any thoughts of hurting myself or others.

Doctor: Have you been able to go about your daily activities, such as work or school?

Patient: It's been difficult. I've been calling out of work more often and have been struggling to keep up with my schoolwork.

Doctor: Based on your symptoms and history, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. I would like to do a more thorough assessment to confirm this diagnosis. 

Patient: Okay, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to feel better.
