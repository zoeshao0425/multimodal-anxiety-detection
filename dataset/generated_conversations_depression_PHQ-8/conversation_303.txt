Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and hopeless. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay, have you experienced any loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't have the energy or desire to do anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've lost my appetite and have lost quite a bit of weight recently.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time. Even when I get enough sleep, I still feel drained.

Doctor: Have you had any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yes, I often feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: I have had thoughts of suicide. It's like a constant voice in my head telling me that life isn't worth living.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. We will need to run some tests to confirm, but I want to start treatment as soon as possible. 

Patient: Okay, thank you. I just want to feel better.
