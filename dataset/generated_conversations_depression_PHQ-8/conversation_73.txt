Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

Patient: Yeah, I've been really tired and have no energy. I don't enjoy things that I used to love doing, and I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life. I've also been having trouble sleeping and have lost my appetite.

Doctor: Okay, those are all common symptoms of depression. Have you noticed any changes in your weight or any physical symptoms?

Patient: No, not really. I've just been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I have. I feel like I'm a burden on my family and friends and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself?

Patient: No, not really. But sometimes I do think that the world would be better off without me.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Have you experienced any traumatic events or major life changes recently?

Patient: Yeah, actually. My partner and I broke up a few months ago, and it's been really hard for me to move on.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: No, not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: It's important to reach out for help when you're feeling this way. Depression is a medical condition that requires treatment. I'm going to diagnose you with depression and recommend that you see a therapist and possibly start taking medication.

Patient: Okay, thank you for taking me seriously. I really appreciate it.
