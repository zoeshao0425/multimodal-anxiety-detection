Doctor: Can you tell me about your mood over the past two weeks?

Patient: I've been feeling pretty down. Like, really sad and hopeless.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things you normally enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing video games but now I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you had any changes in appetite or weight?

Patient: I've been eating less than usual and have lost a bit of weight.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have trouble falling asleep and then I wake up really early feeling exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking energy?

Patient: Yeah, I'm always tired and don't have any motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had those thoughts.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of your situation. Can you tell me about any recent life events that may have contributed to your current mood?

Patient: My girlfriend and I broke up a few months ago and it's been really hard for me to move on. I also lost my job recently, which has been stressful.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been through a lot lately. Based on our conversation, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies. Does that sound okay to you?

Patient: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for your help.
