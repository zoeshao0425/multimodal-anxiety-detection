Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and I've lost some weight.

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you're experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, since you haven't had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. We can discuss some treatment options if you're interested, but it's also possible that these symptoms may improve on their own over time.
