Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have any energy and I can't seem to enjoy anything anymore.

Doctor: Okay, that's understandable. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either sleep too much or not at all. And I've lost my appetite.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling like this?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you experienced any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Alright. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. Let's go through the PHQ-8 assessment to get a better idea of your symptoms.

Doctor: Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?

Patient: Pretty much every day.

Doctor: And how about feeling little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been enjoying anything lately.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or having little energy?

Patient: All the time.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping, either sleeping too much or not enough?

Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping.

Doctor: Have you been feeling bad about yourself, feeling like a failure, or feeling guilty?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching TV?

Patient: Yeah, it's been hard to focus on anything.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite - being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual?

Patient: No, I haven't experienced that.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it does not appear that you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I would like to suggest some lifestyle changes that may improve your mood and energy levels. It's important to get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, and exercise regularly. Additionally, consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings. They may be able to provide additional support and coping strategies.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I will definitely take your advice and try to make those changes.
