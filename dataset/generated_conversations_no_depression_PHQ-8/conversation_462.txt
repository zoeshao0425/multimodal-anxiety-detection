Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and it's been difficult finding a new one. I also broke up with my partner a few months ago and I haven't been able to move on from that.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you have been dealing with a lot of stress and changes in your life. Have you talked to anyone about how you've been feeling?

Patient: No, I haven't really talked to anyone about it. I just try to keep everything to myself.

Doctor: I understand. It's important to know that depression is a common and treatable condition. However, based on your responses, it doesn't seem like you are experiencing severe symptoms of depression. I would recommend that you continue to take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising. It may also be helpful for you to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. Does that sound okay to you?

Patient: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you for your help.
