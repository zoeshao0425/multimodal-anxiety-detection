Doctor: Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to ask a few more questions to understand your situation better. Can you tell me a bit about your personal life?

Patient: Sure, I recently went through a breakup and I've been struggling to cope with it. I also lost my job a few months ago, so I've been feeling stressed about money.

Doctor: I see. It's understandable that these events would cause some stress and sadness. However, based on your responses and your personal situation, I don't believe you have depression. It sounds like you may be experiencing situational sadness, which is a normal response to difficult life events. I recommend seeking support from friends and family, as well as considering therapy to help you cope with these challenges.
