Doctor: Can you tell me about any feelings of sadness or hopelessness that you have been experiencing lately?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been feeling pretty down for a while now. It’s like a cloud is hanging over me all the time.

Doctor: How often do you feel this way?

Patient: Almost every day. It’s been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve lost my appetite and I’ve lost some weight too. I just don’t feel hungry anymore.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I’ve been having trouble sleeping. I just can’t seem to turn my brain off at night.

Doctor: Have you noticed a decrease in energy or motivation?

Patient: Absolutely. I used to be really active and motivated, but now I just don’t have the energy to do anything.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been feeling pretty worthless lately. It’s like nothing I do matters.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven’t had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to note that not everyone who experiences these symptoms necessarily has depression. In your case, I believe that your symptoms may be related to stress or another underlying condition. We’ll need to run some tests to rule out any other potential causes.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That makes me feel a lot better.
