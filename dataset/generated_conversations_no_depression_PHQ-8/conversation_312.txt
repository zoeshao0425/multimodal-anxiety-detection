Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Can you tell me more about your daily life? Are there any significant events that have happened recently?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and I haven't been able to find work since then. I'm also going through a divorce, and it's been difficult to cope with all the changes.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been going through a lot of stress lately. Do you have any support from friends or family?

Patient: My family lives far away, and I don't have many friends in this city.

Doctor: That must be tough. Have you considered seeking help from a therapist or counselor?

Patient: I haven't thought about it, but I'm open to the idea.

Doctor: Okay, I recommend that you speak with a therapist about your situation. Based on our conversation and the PHQ-8 assessment, it doesn't seem like you have depression. However, it's essential to address the stress and changes in your life so that you can feel better.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and advice.
