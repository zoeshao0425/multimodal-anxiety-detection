Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble focusing on anything and I feel like I can't make even simple decisions.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I've been going through a lot of stress at work and I've also had some family issues that have been weighing on me.

Doctor: It's understandable that those things would be causing you stress and impacting your mood. However, based on your answers, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. It sounds like you're experiencing a reaction to stress, which is a normal response. I would recommend focusing on self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that you enjoy. Additionally, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your stressors and how to manage them.
