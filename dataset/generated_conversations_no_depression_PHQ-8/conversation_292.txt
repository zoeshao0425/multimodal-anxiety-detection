Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Do you have a history of depression or mental illness in your family?

Patient: No, not that I know of. I've never been diagnosed with depression before.

Doctor: Okay, based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there could be other factors contributing to your feelings as well. I would like to run some tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. 

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: After reviewing your test results, I can confirm that you don't have depression. However, there are some lifestyle changes that you can make to improve your energy levels and overall mood. I recommend getting regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, and practicing stress-reducing activities like meditation or yoga. If you continue to experience these symptoms, please don't hesitate to come back in for further evaluation. 

Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help.
