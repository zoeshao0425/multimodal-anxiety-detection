Doctor: So, let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any of the following symptoms in the past two weeks?

Patient: Sure, I can try my best to answer your questions.

Doctor: Great. Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: Honestly, I have been feeling a bit low for the past few weeks. I feel like everything is pointless and I'm not sure what the purpose of anything is.

Doctor: Okay. Have you lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, actually. I used to love going out with friends and doing outdoor activities, but now I just don't feel like it. I don't find joy in anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Not really. I eat normally, but I have lost a little bit of weight unintentionally.

Doctor: How about changes in your sleep patterns? Have you been sleeping too much or too little?

Patient: I have been having trouble sleeping lately. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. Then, I'm exhausted during the day.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking energy?

Patient: Yes, I feel like I have no energy to do anything. Even simple tasks seem like a big effort.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Sometimes, yeah. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm a burden to those around me.

Doctor: Lastly, have you been having thoughts of death or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts.

Doctor: Thank you for answering these questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you are not currently experiencing depression. However, I would still like to discuss some coping mechanisms and ways to improve your mood.
