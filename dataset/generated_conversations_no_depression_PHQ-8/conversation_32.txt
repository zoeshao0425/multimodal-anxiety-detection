Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have any energy, and I'm not enjoying things like I used to.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me a little more about how you're feeling? Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual, and I don't have much of an appetite. I've lost some weight because of it.

Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your mood? Do you feel sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really sad all the time. It's like there's a weight on my chest that won't go away. And I don't see things ever getting better.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, it's been really hard to focus on anything. I feel like I'm in a fog, and I can't think clearly.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: And have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had those kinds of thoughts.

Doctor: Alright, thank you for answering those questions. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you had any past experiences with mental health issues?

Patient: No, I've never really had any issues like this before. I've always been pretty happy and outgoing.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to know. Have you experienced any significant life changes recently, like a breakup or job loss?

Patient: No, nothing like that. My life has been pretty stable.

Doctor: Alright. Based on your answers to the questions, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, it's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and come back if they worsen or persist.

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help.
