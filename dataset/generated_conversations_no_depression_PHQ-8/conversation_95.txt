Doctor: So, I understand you're here to discuss your mental health. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty down lately. Like, just really sad and unmotivated.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: I'd say it's been going on for a few months now.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. And I don't really feel like eating much either.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Alright. Have you had any other symptoms, like difficulty concentrating or loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I've definitely been having trouble focusing lately. And I don't really feel like doing anything I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on in your life recently? Any major stressors or changes?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, so that's been pretty stressful. And I've been having some relationship issues with my partner.

Doctor: I see. Those are definitely tough things to deal with. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I haven't wanted to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: I understand. But it's important to reach out for help when you need it. Have you ever considered therapy or counseling?

Patient: Yeah, I've thought about it. But I don't really know where to start.

Doctor: I can give you some resources for therapists in the area if you'd like. And in the meantime, I can prescribe you some medication to help manage your symptoms.

Patient: That sounds good. Thank you.

Doctor: Of course. And just to be sure, I'm going to administer a PHQ-8 assessment to see if you meet the diagnostic criteria for depression.

Doctor: Based on your responses, it looks like you're not currently experiencing depression. However, your symptoms are still cause for concern, and I recommend seeking therapy or counseling to help manage them.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I really appreciate your help.

Doctor: Of course. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.
