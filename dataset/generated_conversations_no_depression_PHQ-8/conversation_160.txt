Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Can you describe that feeling a bit more? How long have you been feeling like this?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just feel really sad and hopeless most of the time. I don't enjoy things that I used to love doing, and I have trouble sleeping at night.

Doctor: That sounds really difficult. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite lately. I just don't feel hungry, even when I know I should eat.

Doctor: Okay. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: That's good to hear. Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling like everything is my fault lately. Even small things that aren't really my responsibility make me feel guilty.

Doctor: I see. Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, I've been having a lot of trouble with that. I feel like my mind is foggy all the time, and I can't focus on anything for very long.

Doctor: Okay. And have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, I haven't had any physical symptoms.

Doctor: Alright. Based on what you've told me, it does sound like you're experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that depression is a medical condition that can be treated. We can work together to come up with a treatment plan that works for you.
