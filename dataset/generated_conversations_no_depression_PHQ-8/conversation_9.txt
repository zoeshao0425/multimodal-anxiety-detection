Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I would like to rule out any other medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms. We'll need to run some tests to make sure everything is okay.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: After running some tests, we have determined that you do not have depression. However, it's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and seeking help if they persist or worsen. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.
