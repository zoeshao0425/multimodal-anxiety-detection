Doctor: So, you mentioned that you've been feeling down lately. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're experiencing?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad all the time. I don't have much energy and I don't enjoy doing things like I used to.

Doctor: Okay. How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I'm having trouble sleeping at night and I've lost my appetite.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: And have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, it's been really hard to focus on anything and I've been making a lot of mistakes at work.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that information with me. Based on what you've described, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of your situation.

Patient: Sure, go ahead.

Doctor: Have you experienced any significant life changes or stressors recently?

Patient: Well, my grandmother passed away a few weeks ago and that's been really hard for me.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. And how has your support system been during this time? Do you have friends or family members that you can talk to?

Patient: Yeah, I've been talking to my mom a lot and she's been really supportive.

Doctor: That's great to hear. Based on what you've shared with me, I don't think that you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. However, I would recommend that you continue to take care of yourself and seek support from your loved ones during this difficult time. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or another healthcare provider.
