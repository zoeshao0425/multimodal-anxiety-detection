Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and have been struggling to find a new one. I also went through a breakup with my partner. It's been really tough.

Doctor: Based on your symptoms and personal background, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. However, after evaluating your responses to the PHQ-8 assessment, it appears that your symptoms are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression.

Patient: That's a relief to hear. What can I do to improve my mood and get back to feeling like myself again?

Doctor: There are several things that you can do, such as practicing self-care, exercising regularly, and seeking support from friends and family. I can also refer you to a therapist who can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.
