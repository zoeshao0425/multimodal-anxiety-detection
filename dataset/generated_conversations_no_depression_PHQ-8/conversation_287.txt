Doctor: Okay, based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I'm going to diagnose you as not having depression at this time. It's important to keep an eye on these symptoms and if they persist or worsen, please schedule another appointment with me. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get regular exercise, eating healthy, and getting enough sleep to see if that helps improve your mood.
