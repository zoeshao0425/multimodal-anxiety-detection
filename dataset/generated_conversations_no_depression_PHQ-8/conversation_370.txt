Doctor: Alright, based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that depression can often be caused by underlying medical conditions, so we'll need to run some tests to rule those out. In the meantime, I recommend that you try to get plenty of rest, eat well, and exercise regularly. We can also explore some therapy options to help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
