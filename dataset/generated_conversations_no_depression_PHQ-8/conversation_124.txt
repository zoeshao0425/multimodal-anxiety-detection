Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad. I don't enjoy doing things that I used to love, and I often feel like I have no energy.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleeping patterns or appetite?

Patient: Yes, actually. I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite. I've also been feeling very irritable and on edge.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just can't seem to shake it.

Doctor: Have you noticed any thoughts of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel like there's no point in anything and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any significant life events or changes recently?

Patient: Well, I did lose my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find work since then. That's been really stressful.

Doctor: I see. And how has this been impacting your daily life? Are you able to function as usual?

Patient: It's been really hard. I don't have the motivation to do much of anything, and I've been avoiding social situations. It's like I'm just going through the motions.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'm going to administer the PHQ-8 assessment just to be sure.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it appears that you do not meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder. However, it's clear that you're struggling and could benefit from some support. I'd like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through these feelings and develop some coping strategies.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That sounds like a good idea.
