Doctor: So, I understand that you've been feeling down lately. Can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad and hopeless all the time. I don't enjoy things that used to make me happy, and I have trouble sleeping.

Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Actually, yes. I've lost my appetite and have lost some weight recently.

Doctor: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or ability to concentrate?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really tired all the time and have trouble focusing on anything. It's affecting my work and personal life.

Doctor: I see. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, not really. I just feel really down all the time.

Doctor: Alright. Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or body aches?

Patient: No, not really. Just the lack of appetite and weight loss.

Doctor: Okay. And have you experienced any traumatic events recently?

Patient: No, nothing like that. It's just been a rough year overall.

Doctor: I understand. Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and have been struggling to find work. My relationship with my partner has been strained, and I've been feeling pretty isolated from my friends and family.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. Based on what you've told me, it doesn't seem like you meet the criteria for depression. However, it's important to continue to monitor your symptoms and seek help if they worsen. In the meantime, I recommend seeking support from loved ones and trying to engage in self-care activities like exercise and relaxation techniques.
