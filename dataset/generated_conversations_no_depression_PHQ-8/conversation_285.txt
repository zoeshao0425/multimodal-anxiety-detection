Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Well, I've been feeling pretty down, to be honest. I just don't have much energy, and I don't really feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe that a little more? Have you been having trouble sleeping or eating?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep, or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. And I haven't had much of an appetite either.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it. And even when I do force myself to go out, I don't really enjoy it like I used to.

Doctor: Okay, and have you been feeling hopeless or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, I guess so. I just feel kind of useless and like nothing really matters.

Doctor: And have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I don't think I would ever do something like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for being honest with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Would you be willing to take a PHQ-8 assessment to help me better understand your symptoms?

Patient: Sure, I'll do whatever I need to do to feel better.

(Doctor administers the PHQ-8 assessment)

Doctor: Based on your responses, it looks like you're not currently experiencing depression. However, that doesn't mean that what you're feeling isn't valid or important. It's possible that you could be experiencing some situational depression or just going through a tough time. I'd like to suggest that you continue to monitor your mood and symptoms, and if things don't improve or get worse, please come back and see me.

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help. I appreciate it.
