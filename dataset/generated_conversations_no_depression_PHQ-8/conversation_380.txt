Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Okay, let's talk about that. Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yes, I have. It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've lost my appetite and I've lost a few pounds.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I'm having trouble sleeping. I can't seem to fall asleep at night.

Doctor: Do you feel restless or slowed down?

Patient: I feel really tired all the time. I don't have any energy to do anything.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing video games, but I just don't feel like doing it anymore.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Are you going through any major changes or stressors right now?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job, and I've been having trouble finding a new one. It's been really stressful.

Doctor: Okay, that could definitely be contributing to how you're feeling. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I'm going to ask you a few more questions to make sure.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: No, I haven't noticed any problems with that.

Doctor: Have you felt guilty or worthless?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Have you had any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those.

Doctor: Okay, based on your answers, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, losing your job and the stress that comes with it can definitely cause feelings of sadness and lack of motivation. I would suggest seeking out some counseling or therapy to help you cope with this difficult time.
