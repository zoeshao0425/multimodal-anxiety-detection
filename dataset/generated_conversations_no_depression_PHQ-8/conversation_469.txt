Doctor: Can you tell me a bit about why you're here today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately, and I'm not sure what's going on. I thought maybe it could be depression.

Doctor: Okay, let's talk about that. Have you been feeling sad or hopeless?

Patient: Yes, definitely. It's like I can't shake this feeling of sadness no matter what I do.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with my friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it. It's like everything is too much effort.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been sleeping a lot more than usual, and I still feel tired all the time.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I haven't really been hungry lately, and I've lost a bit of weight without trying.

Doctor: Have you been feeling anxious or restless?

Patient: Not really, it's more like I just feel numb.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Can you tell me a bit more about your life right now? Are you going through any major changes or stressors?

Patient: Well, I just started a new job a few months ago, and it's been pretty stressful. I also broke up with my partner recently, which has been tough.

Doctor: I see. How have those things been affecting your daily life?

Patient: I've been having trouble concentrating at work, and I've been feeling really isolated since the breakup. It's like I don't have the energy to reach out to my friends or family.

Doctor: I understand. Based on what you've told me, it does sound like you're going through a tough time. However, I don't think you meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depression. It sounds like your symptoms are related to the stressors in your life right now.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense. What can I do to start feeling better?

Doctor: I would recommend trying to find ways to manage your stress, like exercise or meditation. It might also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. And of course, don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need anything else.
