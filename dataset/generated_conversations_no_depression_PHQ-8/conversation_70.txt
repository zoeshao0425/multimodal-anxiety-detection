Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. And I haven't had much of an appetite either.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood? Do you feel sad or empty most of the time?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or body aches?

Patient: Not really, just feeling tired all the time.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life events recently that could be contributing to your feelings?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find work since then. It's been really stressful.

Doctor: That could definitely contribute to your feelings. Have you talked to anyone about what you're going through?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: It's important to talk to someone about what you're going through. There's no shame in seeking help. Based on our conversation, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to clarify that you don't meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. 

Patient: That's a relief to hear. 

Doctor: It's important to take care of yourself and seek help if you need it. Please feel free to reach out to me or another healthcare professional if you ever need to talk.
