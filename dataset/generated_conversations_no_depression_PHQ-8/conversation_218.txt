Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you are experiencing symptoms of depression. However, your score on the PHQ-8 assessment is not high enough to diagnose you with depression. It's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and continue to monitor how you're feeling. If your symptoms worsen or persist, please come back and see me. In the meantime, I recommend practicing self-care and seeking support from loved ones.
