Doctor: So, let's start with the first question. Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?

Patient: Honestly, it's been almost every day. I just feel really sad and like nothing is going right in my life.

Doctor: I see. And have you lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and playing sports, but now I just don't have the energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Okay, next question. Have you had trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping lately. I either can't fall asleep or wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Alright. Have you been feeling tired or having little energy lately?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time, even when I haven't done much during the day.

Doctor: Have you noticed a change in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Not really. I've been eating about the same as usual, but I have lost a few pounds without trying.

Doctor: Have you been feeling bad about yourself or that you're a failure, or have let yourself or your family down?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm not living up to my potential. I also feel guilty about things that I shouldn't be feeling guilty about.

Doctor: Okay. Have you been having trouble concentrating on things like reading the newspaper or watching TV?

Patient: Definitely. I have a hard time focusing on anything and my mind feels really foggy.

Doctor: And finally, have you been thinking that you would be better off dead or hurting yourself in some way?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Based on your responses, it seems like you have been experiencing a lot of symptoms commonly associated with depression. However, I would like to do some more tests and evaluations to rule out any other medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

Doctor: After further evaluation, it appears that you do not meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis. However, we can still work together to find ways to improve your mood and overall well-being.
