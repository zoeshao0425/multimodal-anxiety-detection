Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I just don't have any motivation to do anything and I've been having trouble sleeping.

Doctor: Okay, when did these symptoms start?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Not really, but I have been feeling pretty fatigued.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel like everything is my fault and I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been hard to focus on anything lately.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing soccer, but now I just don't have the energy for it.

Doctor: Thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there can be many different factors that contribute to these feelings.

Patient: That makes sense. I've been going through a lot lately with work and family stuff.

Doctor: Yes, it's definitely possible that those things could be contributing to how you're feeling. But I'd like to rule out any underlying medical conditions as well. So, I'm going to do a physical exam and some blood work just to make sure everything looks okay.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: In the meantime, I'd like you to try to focus on taking care of yourself. That means getting plenty of rest, eating a healthy diet, and trying to stay active even if you don't feel like it. And if you ever have any thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please let me know right away so we can get you the help you need.

Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help.

Doctor: Of course. And just to let you know, based on your answers to the questions, you don't meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. But we'll keep an eye on things and see how you're doing.
