Patient: Almost every day for the past few weeks.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yes, I have been eating less than usual and have lost some weight.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have trouble falling asleep at night and often wake up early in the morning feeling tired.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just feel like staying home and not doing anything.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yes, sometimes I feel like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Doctor: Thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a bit about your personal background?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup and have been having trouble adjusting to being single again. I also lost my job a few months ago and have been struggling financially.

Doctor: I see. Those are definitely stressful situations that could contribute to depression. However, based on your responses, it doesn't sound like you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. I would recommend seeking support from friends and family, as well as considering therapy to help you cope with these difficult circumstances.
