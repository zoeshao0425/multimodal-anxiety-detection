Doctor: Based on your symptoms and experiences, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, after our conversation and reviewing the PHQ-8 assessment, I do not believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. I would recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms and seek help if they persist or worsen. It's important to take care of yourself and reach out for support when you need it.
