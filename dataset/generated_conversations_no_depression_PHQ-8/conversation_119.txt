Doctor: Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job, and it's been really hard finding a new one. I also broke up with my partner, and that's been tough too.

Doctor: I see. It's understandable that you're feeling down given those circumstances. However, based on your responses, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. That being said, it's important to keep an eye on your symptoms and seek help if they worsen. 

Patient: Okay, thank you for letting me know. What can I do to start feeling better?

Doctor: There are a few things you can try. First, make sure you're taking care of your physical health by getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. You may also want to consider talking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings. Additionally, there are medications that can help with depression if your symptoms persist.
