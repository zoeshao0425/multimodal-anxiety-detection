Doctor: Can you tell me about any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or emptiness you've been experiencing?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. It's like I can't shake this feeling of sadness no matter what I do. I feel hopeless and like there's no point in anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: My appetite has definitely decreased, and I'm having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or wake up multiple times during the night.

Doctor: Have you experienced any loss of interest or pleasure in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing video games and watching movies, but now I just don't have the motivation to do those things anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or ability to concentrate?

Patient: I feel exhausted all the time, and it's hard to focus on anything. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of my daily routine.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting myself or ending my life.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having frequent headaches and my stomach has been bothering me lately.

Doctor: Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that not everyone experiences depression in the same way. Can you tell me a bit about your personal background and any recent life events that may be contributing to your current state?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and have been struggling to find a new one. My relationship with my partner has also been strained, and we've been arguing a lot lately.

Doctor: It's understandable that these events could be contributing to your current feelings. However, it's important to note that you don't meet the criteria for depression according to the PHQ-8 assessment. I would recommend seeking support from a therapist or counselor to help you cope with these challenges and work towards feeling better. Would you be open to that?

Patient: Yes, I think that could be helpful. Thank you for your time and understanding.
