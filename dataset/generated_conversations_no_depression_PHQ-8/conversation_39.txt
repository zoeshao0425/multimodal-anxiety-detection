Doctor: So, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately? Have you been feeling down or sad?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty low lately. It's like everything just feels really heavy and I don't have the energy to do anything.

Doctor: Okay, and how often would you say you've been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been pretty consistent for the past few weeks. Maybe every day or every other day.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep habits?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't really been eating much lately and I've had trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your level of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing video games but now I just don't feel like doing anything. Even when I try to play, I just can't get into it.

Doctor: And have you been feeling more tired or fatigued than usual?

Patient: Definitely. Even when I get enough sleep, I still feel exhausted all the time.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Alright, and have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Not really, just the fatigue and lack of appetite.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other factors like stress or a medical condition. Would you mind sharing a little bit about your personal background and any recent life events that could be contributing to how you're feeling?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup which has been pretty tough. And I've also been having some financial issues which have been stressing me out.

Doctor: I see. Those are definitely difficult things to deal with. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling or sought any support?

Patient: No, not really. I've just been trying to deal with it on my own.

Doctor: It's understandable to want to handle things on your own, but sometimes it can be helpful to talk to someone about what you're going through. I'm glad you came in today and we can work together to figure out the best way to support you. Based on our conversation, it doesn't seem like you meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis of depression. However, I would still recommend seeking additional support and resources to help you cope with what you're going through. Would you be open to exploring some options for counseling or therapy?

Patient: Yeah, I think that could be helpful.

Doctor: Great. I can provide you with some referrals and resources to get started. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else or if your symptoms worsen. We're here to support you.
