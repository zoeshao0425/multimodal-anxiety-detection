Doctor: Hi, I understand that you're here to talk about your mental health. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on?

Patient: Yeah, I've just been feeling really down lately. Like nothing really brings me joy anymore.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe that feeling a little more? Have you been experiencing sadness or hopelessness?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like everything is pointless and I don't see the point in doing anything anymore.

Doctor: Alright, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping lately. And I haven't really been eating as much as I used to.

Doctor: Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your energy level or motivation?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really tired all the time. And I don't really feel like doing anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you noticed any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel like I'm not good enough and I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Okay, and have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't.

Doctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and I've been having trouble finding a new one. And my relationship with my partner has been really strained lately.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been going through a lot of stress lately. Based on what you've told me, it doesn't sound like you meet the criteria for depression. However, I would recommend seeking out therapy or counseling to help you cope with the stressors in your life.
