Doctor: So, tell me about what's been going on lately. Have you been feeling down or sad?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling really down lately. I just don't feel like myself.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been a few weeks now.

Doctor: Okay, let's talk about some of the symptoms you've been experiencing. Have you been feeling little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: Yes, I used to love going out with my friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yes, I've lost my appetite and have lost a few pounds.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have trouble sleeping. I just can't seem to fall asleep at night.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or having low energy?

Patient: Yes, I feel tired all the time. Even when I wake up in the morning, I still feel tired.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything I do is wrong.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, I can't seem to focus on anything. I'm always distracted and can't make decisions.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I also want to ask if there have been any recent life events that may have contributed to how you're feeling?

Patient: Well, my grandmother passed away a few weeks ago. We were very close and it's been really hard for me.

Doctor: I'm so sorry to hear that. It's normal to feel sad and grieve after losing someone close to you. However, it's important to recognize the difference between normal grief and depression.

Patient: That makes sense.

Doctor: Based on our conversation, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, it's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and seeking support if needed. I recommend you check in with me in a few weeks to see how you're doing. In the meantime, try to take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.
