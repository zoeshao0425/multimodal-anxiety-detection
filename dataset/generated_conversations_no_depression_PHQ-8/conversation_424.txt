Doctor: So, let's start by discussing your symptoms. Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very down lately. It's like everything seems to be going wrong, and I can't seem to find any joy in anything anymore.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: I would say for the past few weeks. It started off as just feeling a bit sad, but it has progressively gotten worse.

Doctor: Are you experiencing a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I used to love going out with friends, but now I don't even feel like leaving my house.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yes, I've lost my appetite completely. I don't feel like eating anything at all, and I've lost quite a bit of weight.

Doctor: Do you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?

Patient: Yes, I find it hard to fall asleep at night, and then I wake up several times throughout the night.

Doctor: Do you feel tired or have low energy throughout the day?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time. Even getting out of bed in the morning feels like a huge effort.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it doesn't seem like you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I would still like to discuss some options for improving your mood and overall well-being. Would you be open to that?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I want to feel better and get back to enjoying life again.
