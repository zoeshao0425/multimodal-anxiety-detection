Doctor: So, let's start with the first question. Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: I would say almost every day. It's been really difficult to shake off this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay. And have you experienced a loss of interest or pleasure in doing things you normally enjoy?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I used to love going out with my friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel motivated to do anything.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: My appetite has decreased, and I've lost some weight as a result. I just don't feel hungry most of the time.

Doctor: How about changes in your sleep patterns? Have you been sleeping more or less than usual?

Patient: I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I often take naps during the day.

Doctor: Have you felt tired or had low energy recently?

Patient: Yes, I'm constantly tired, even after getting a lot of sleep. It's hard to find the energy to do anything.

Doctor: Have you felt guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yes, I've been feeling really down on myself. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything I do is wrong.

Doctor: And have you experienced any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup, and it's been really hard for me to cope with. I've also been having trouble at work, and I just feel like everything is falling apart.

Doctor: I see. It's understandable that you're feeling this way given everything you've been going through. However, based on your answers to the questions, it doesn't seem like your symptoms are severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of depression. It's important to take care of yourself during this difficult time and seek support from loved ones or a therapist if needed.
