Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and unmotivated.

Doctor: Can you describe your mood over the past two weeks?

Patient: It's just been really low. I don't feel like doing anything and I'm always tired. I'm not even interested in things that used to make me happy.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping?

Patient: I've been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?

Patient: My energy levels have been really low. I just feel exhausted all the time.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those thoughts.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble focusing and making decisions. It's like my mind is always foggy.

Doctor: Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to do a full evaluation to make sure. Do you have any history of depression or mental illness in your family?

Patient: No, not that I know of.

Doctor: Have there been any major life events or stressors that could be contributing to your symptoms?

Patient: Well, I did lose my job a few months ago and I've been having trouble finding a new one. That's been really stressful.

Doctor: That could definitely be a contributing factor. However, based on your responses to the PHQ-8 assessment, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression at this time. It's important to continue to monitor your symptoms and seek help if they worsen or persist. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on self-care and finding healthy ways to manage stress.
