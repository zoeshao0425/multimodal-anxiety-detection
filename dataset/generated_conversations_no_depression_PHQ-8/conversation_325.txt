Doctor: Lastly, have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts of hurting myself or suicide.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it appears that you are experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there are other medical conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Can you tell me a bit more about your personal life and any recent events that may have triggered these feelings?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job, and I've been struggling to find a new one. My relationship with my partner has also been strained, and I don't have many close friends in the area.

Doctor: I see. It's understandable that these events would cause you to feel depressed. However, based on our conversation, it appears that your symptoms may be related to situational factors rather than clinical depression. I recommend that you take some time for self-care, such as exercise, meditation, and talking to a therapist. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please come back to see me.

Patient: Thank you for your help, doctor. I'll make sure to take care of myself and seek further help if needed.
