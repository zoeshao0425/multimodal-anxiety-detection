Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there could be other factors contributing to your feelings as well. Let's talk more about your personal life and experiences to get a better understanding of what could be causing these symptoms.

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup and it's been really tough for me. I also lost my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find a new one.

Doctor: Those are definitely significant stressors that could be contributing to your feelings. It's important to take care of yourself during difficult times like these. I would recommend seeking support from friends and family, as well as considering therapy or counseling to help you work through your emotions.

Patient: That's a good idea. I'll definitely consider it.

Doctor: Based on our conversation, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression at this time. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or another healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.
