Doctor: So, let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any of the following symptoms over the past two weeks: little interest or pleasure in doing things, feeling down or hopeless, trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, feeling tired or having little energy, poor appetite or overeating, feeling bad about yourself or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down, trouble concentrating on things such as reading the newspaper or watching television, or moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? 

Patient: Well, I have been feeling down and hopeless for a while now. I don't enjoy doing things that I used to love, like playing video games or hanging out with friends. I have trouble sleeping at night, and I feel tired all the time. I also find myself eating a lot more than usual, and I feel bad about myself because of it. I can't concentrate on anything, and I feel like I'm moving really slowly.

Doctor: How has this affected your daily life? Do you find it difficult to go to work or school, or to take care of yourself?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really tough. I've been missing a lot of work because I just can't bring myself to get out of bed in the morning. I've also been neglecting my personal hygiene and haven't been taking care of myself like I should be.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently that may have triggered these symptoms?

Patient: Well, my grandmother passed away a few months ago, and that was really hard for me. I've also been going through a lot of relationship problems with my girlfriend, and that's been weighing heavily on me.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other factors, such as a medical condition or a side effect of medication. I would like to conduct some further testing to rule out any other potential causes.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good to me.

Doctor: After conducting the testing, I have determined that you do not have depression. However, I would like to refer you to a therapist to help you work through the grief and relationship issues you mentioned. It's important to take care of your mental health, and therapy can be a great tool for that. 

Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance.
