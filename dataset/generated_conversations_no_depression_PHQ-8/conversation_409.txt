Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that these symptoms can be caused by other factors as well. I recommend we run some tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That makes sense. 

Doctor: In the meantime, I would recommend that you try to get some exercise, eat healthy foods, and get enough sleep. These things can help improve your mood and energy levels. Additionally, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings and experiences.

Patient: That's a good idea. I'll try to take care of myself better and look into seeing a therapist. Thank you, doctor. 

Doctor: You're welcome. Remember, there's no shame in seeking help when you need it.
