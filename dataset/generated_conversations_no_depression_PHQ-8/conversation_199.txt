Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down. I've lost interest in things I used to enjoy, like going out with friends or watching movies. I feel tired all the time and have trouble sleeping at night.

Doctor: Okay, those are some common symptoms of depression. Have you experienced any changes in appetite or weight?

Patient: Actually, yes. I've been eating a lot less than usual and have lost a few pounds.

Doctor: And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or ability to concentrate?

Patient: Yes, I feel really fatigued all the time and have trouble focusing on tasks at work.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty hopeless lately. Like nothing is going to get better and there's no point in trying.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Have you experienced any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: That's good to hear. Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on in your life lately? Any major changes or stressors?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup and it's been really tough for me. I also lost my job a few months ago, so I've been struggling financially.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of difficult situations lately. Based on what you've shared with me today, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I do think it would be helpful for you to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you've been going through. They can provide you with coping strategies and support during this challenging time.
