Doctor: So, let's start by talking about your mood. How often have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless in the past two weeks?

Patient: Honestly, I've been feeling like that almost every day. It's been hard to shake off this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: And have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy doing?

Patient: Yes, I used to love going out with friends and playing sports, but now I don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yes, I've lost some weight because I haven't been eating as much as I used to.

Doctor: Do you have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have trouble falling asleep and I wake up multiple times during the night.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or low on energy lately?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time, even when I wake up in the morning.

Doctor: Do you have feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Sometimes, I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a little bit more about your personal life and any recent events that may have triggered these feelings?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup and it's been really hard for me. I also lost my job a few months ago, so I've been feeling pretty stressed about money.

Doctor: I see. Those are definitely tough situations to deal with. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden my friends or family with my problems.

Doctor: It's important to remember that seeking help is not a burden. I recommend that you talk to a therapist or counselor about your feelings and experiences. In addition, I don't think you meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis.
