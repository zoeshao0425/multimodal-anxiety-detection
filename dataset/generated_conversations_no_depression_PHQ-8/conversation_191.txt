Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and unmotivated.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really sad all the time. And I just don't enjoy things like I used to. Even things that used to make me happy just don't interest me anymore.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. And it's been getting worse.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep at night or I wake up really early and can't get back to sleep. And I haven't really been hungry. I've been skipping meals because I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really hopeless and helpless.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really. Just the lack of appetite and trouble sleeping.

Doctor: Have you been able to go to work or school as usual?

Patient: It's been really hard to focus and concentrate. I've been calling in sick to work because I just can't bring myself to go in.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently?

Patient: Yeah, actually. I lost my job a few weeks ago and it's been really hard to find a new one. And my girlfriend broke up with me around the same time.

Doctor: I see. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to administer a PHQ-8 assessment to get a better understanding of your symptoms.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

Doctor: Based on your responses to the PHQ-8 assessment, it appears that you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, given the recent life changes and stressors you've experienced, it's understandable that you're feeling down and unmotivated. I would recommend seeking support from a therapist or counselor to help you cope with these challenges and improve your mood.

Patient: That sounds like a good idea. Thank you for your help.
