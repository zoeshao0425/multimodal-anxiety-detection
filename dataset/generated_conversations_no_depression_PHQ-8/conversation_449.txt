Doctor: Thank you for answering these questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to ask you a few more questions to get a better understanding of your situation.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes recently, such as a loss of a loved one, a job, or a relationship?

Patient: No, nothing like that has happened.

Doctor: Have you been under a lot of stress lately, either at home or at work?

Patient: Yes, I've been feeling overwhelmed with work and family responsibilities.

Doctor: Based on our conversation, it seems like your symptoms may be related to stress rather than depression. I recommend that you try to reduce your stress levels by taking breaks, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking support from family and friends. If your symptoms persist, please come back to see me, and we can discuss further treatment options.
