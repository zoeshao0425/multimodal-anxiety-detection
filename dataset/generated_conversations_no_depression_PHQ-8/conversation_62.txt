Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have trouble falling asleep at night, but then I sleep in late in the morning.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I haven't been eating as much as I used to, and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, it's hard for me to focus on anything, and I feel like I can't make even simple decisions.

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about your daily functioning? Are you able to do your usual activities?

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'm going to ask you a few more questions to get a better understanding of your condition.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Have you experienced any recent significant life events, such as the loss of a loved one or a job?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: No, this is the first time I've felt like this.

Doctor: Based on our conversation and the PHQ-8 assessment, I'm not seeing any indications of depression. However, I would like to monitor your symptoms and see you again in a few weeks to make sure you're feeling better.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That makes me feel better.
