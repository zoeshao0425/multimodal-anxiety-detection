Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've described, it does sound like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I would like to do a more thorough assessment to make sure. 

(Doctor proceeds to administer the PHQ-8 assessment)

Doctor: Based on your answers, it looks like you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, it's clear that you've been going through a tough time recently and it's understandable that you've been feeling down. I would recommend that you continue to take care of yourself and seek support from friends and family. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please don't hesitate to come back and see me.

Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help.
