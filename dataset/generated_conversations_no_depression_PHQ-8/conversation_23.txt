Doctor: So, tell me, what brings you in today?

Patient: Well, I’ve been feeling really down lately. I just can’t seem to shake this feeling.

Doctor: I see. How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: About a month or so.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been eating less and I’ve lost a few pounds.

Doctor: And how about your sleep? Have you been sleeping more or less than usual?

Patient: Less. I’m having trouble falling asleep at night and I wake up early in the morning.

Doctor: Have you experienced any loss of interest or pleasure in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with my friends, but now I just don’t feel like it.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yes, all the time.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been having trouble focusing at work.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background? Have you experienced any major life changes recently?

Patient: Well, I just went through a breakup a few months ago, and I’ve been feeling pretty lonely since then.

Doctor: I see. And how has this been impacting your daily functioning? Have you been able to go to work or school as usual?

Patient: It’s been tough. I’ve been calling in sick a lot and I’m having trouble keeping up with my responsibilities.

Doctor: Based on your symptoms and our conversation, I think it’s possible that you’re experiencing depression. However, I’d like to run some tests to rule out any other medical conditions. 

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

(After running the tests)

Doctor: Based on the results of your tests, it looks like you don’t have any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. However, I don’t believe you’re experiencing depression at this time.

Patient: Really? That’s a relief.

Doctor: Yes. It’s possible that your recent breakup and feelings of loneliness are contributing to your symptoms. I’d recommend seeking therapy or counseling to help you work through these issues and develop coping strategies.

Patient: Okay, I’ll look into that. Thank you for your help.

Doctor: Of course. And please don’t hesitate to come back if you have any further concerns or symptoms.
