Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that depression is a medical condition that can be treated. Would you be open to discussing treatment options with me?

Doctor: That's understandable. It's important to remember that everyone goes through difficult times, and it's normal to feel sad or down at times. However, if you ever feel like your symptoms are getting worse or you're having trouble coping, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or a mental health professional for help.
