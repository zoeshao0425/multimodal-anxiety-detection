Doctor: So, tell me a little about what brings you in today.

Patient: I’ve been feeling really down lately. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I just can’t seem to shake this feeling.

Doctor: Okay, can you describe what you mean by feeling down? What are some of the specific symptoms you’ve been experiencing?

Patient: Well, I’ve been feeling really sad and hopeless. I don’t enjoy things that I used to like doing, and I’m having trouble sleeping. I’ve also been feeling really tired all the time, even when I get plenty of rest.

Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been eating less than usual, and I’ve lost a few pounds recently.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, I haven’t had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: That’s good to hear. Have you experienced any difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, I’ve definitely noticed that. It’s been hard for me to focus on anything, and I’ve been making mistakes at work because of it.

Doctor: I understand. Have you ever experienced these symptoms before?

Patient: Yeah, I have felt like this before, but usually it goes away after a few days.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a little about your personal life? Are there any major stressors or life changes that could be contributing to your symptoms?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup, and that’s been really hard for me. I’ve also been having some financial troubles, which has been stressful.

Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a better sense of what’s going on.

Patient: Okay, sure.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I have been feeling like I’m not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Based on your responses, it sounds like you are experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I would like to clarify that this does not necessarily mean you have depression. It’s important to remember that everyone experiences sadness and stress at times, and these feelings can be normal reactions to difficult situations.

Patient: Oh, okay. So what should I do?

Doctor: I would recommend trying to take care of yourself by getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. It can also be helpful to talk to someone you trust about what you’re going through, whether that’s a friend, family member, or therapist. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me.
