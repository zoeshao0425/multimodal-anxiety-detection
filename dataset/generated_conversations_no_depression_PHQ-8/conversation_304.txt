Patient: Almost every day. It's been really hard to shake off this feeling.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in doing things that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, I have. I used to love going out with my friends, but now I just can't seem to find the energy to do anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yes, I have lost my appetite and I have lost some weight as well.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping or have you been sleeping too much?

Patient: I have been having trouble sleeping. I find it hard to fall asleep and when I do, I wake up feeling tired.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued lately?

Patient: Yes, I feel tired all the time. Even when I wake up in the morning, I don't feel rested.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very guilty and worthless. I feel like I am not good enough and that I am letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that not everyone who experiences these symptoms has depression. I would like to run some tests to rule out any other medical conditions that may be causing your symptoms.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and help me figure out what's going on.

Doctor: Of course, it's my job to help you feel better. Let's work together to find a solution that works for you.
