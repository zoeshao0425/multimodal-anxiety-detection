Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and have been having trouble finding a new one. It's been causing a lot of financial stress for me and my family.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other factors such as stress or a medical condition. I would like to run some tests to rule out any underlying medical issues. In the meantime, I recommend seeking support from a therapist or counselor to help manage your symptoms. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
