Doctor: Okay, based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background and any significant life events that may have contributed to your current state?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup and it has been really difficult for me. I also lost my job a few months ago, so I've been struggling financially.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you have been going through a lot lately. Based on what you've told me, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I would like to keep an eye on your symptoms and see how you are doing in a few weeks. In the meantime, I recommend trying to stay active, getting enough sleep, and talking to supportive friends and family members. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please don't hesitate to reach out to me again.
