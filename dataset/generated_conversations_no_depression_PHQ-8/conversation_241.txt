Patient: Well, I just went through a breakup and that's been really tough. And work has been really stressful lately too.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that not everyone who experiences these symptoms has depression. Let's talk more about your personal background and any other factors that might be contributing to how you're feeling. 

Patient: Actually, now that we've talked more, I think a lot of my feelings are related to my recent breakup and work stress. I don't think I have depression, but I do think I need to work on managing my stress better.

Doctor: That's a great insight. It's important to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally. I can refer you to some resources and support groups that might be helpful for you.
