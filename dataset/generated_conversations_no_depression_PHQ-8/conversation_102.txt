Doctor: So, let's start by discussing your mood over the past two weeks. Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: Yes, I have been feeling very down lately. It's been difficult to get out of bed in the morning and I don't feel motivated to do anything.

Doctor: How often have you been feeling this way?

Patient: Almost every day for the past two weeks.

Doctor: Okay, have you experienced a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, I used to love going for walks and spending time with my friends, but now I don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yes, I've lost my appetite and have lost some weight as a result.

Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping or been sleeping more than usual?

Patient: I have been having trouble sleeping. I find it hard to fall asleep at night and wake up several times throughout the night.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking energy?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time, even after a full night's sleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt?

Patient: No, I haven't experienced those feelings.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those thoughts.

Doctor: Based on your responses, I don't believe you are experiencing depression. However, I would like to explore other possible causes for your symptoms. Have you experienced any recent stressful events or changes in your life?

Patient: Yes, I lost my job a few weeks ago, and it's been difficult to adjust to the change.

Doctor: Losing a job can definitely be a stressful event. It's important to take care of yourself during this time and seek support from loved ones. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to check in on your symptoms and see how you're doing.
