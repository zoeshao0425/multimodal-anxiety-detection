Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. It sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background and any recent life events that may have contributed to these feelings?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup and it's been really hard for me to move on from it. I also lost my job a few months ago and have been struggling to find a new one.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been going through a lot of stressors lately. Have you tried any coping mechanisms or talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: I've tried talking to my friends and family, but they don't really seem to understand what I'm going through.

Doctor: Well, I'm glad you came to me today. Based on your answers, it doesn't seem like you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, it's important to continue to monitor your symptoms and seek help if they worsen or persist.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and advice.
