Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'm going to administer a PHQ-8 assessment to get a better understanding of your condition.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: After reviewing your responses, it looks like you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I would like to continue monitoring your symptoms and schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to see how you're doing.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and support.
