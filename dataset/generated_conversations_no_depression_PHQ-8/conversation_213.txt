Let's talk more about your personal background and experiences to better understand what might be going on.

Patient: Okay, well I recently went through a breakup and it's been really hard on me. I also lost my job a few months ago and I've been struggling to find work since then.

Doctor: I see. It's understandable that these events would have an impact on your mental health. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: No, I haven't really told anyone. I didn't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: It's important to remember that seeking help is not a burden. It's a brave and necessary step towards feeling better. Based on our conversation, I don't think you have depression at this time, but I would recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms and consider talking to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide support as you navigate this difficult time.
