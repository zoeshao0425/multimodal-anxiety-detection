Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not very good. I've been feeling really down and sad most of the time.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How often do you feel this way?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. Sometimes it's worse than others, but I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping and I don't really have much of an appetite anymore.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in things that you used to enjoy doing?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and playing sports, but now I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Do you ever feel guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, all the time. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm letting everyone down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like fatigue or aches and pains?

Patient: Yeah, I'm always tired and my body just feels heavy and achy.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'd like to do a full assessment to be sure.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense. 

(After the assessment)

Doctor: Based on your responses, it doesn't appear that you are currently experiencing depression. However, if your symptoms persist or worsen, please don't hesitate to reach out to me again.

Patient: Thank you, that's a relief to hear.
