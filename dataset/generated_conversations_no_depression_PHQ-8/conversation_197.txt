Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad. I'm having trouble sleeping, and I don't have any energy. I just feel really hopeless and helpless.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just can't seem to shake it.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite, and I've lost some weight as well.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yes, I have. I feel like everything is my fault, and I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life events or stressors recently?

Patient: Well, I did lose my job a few months ago, and I've been struggling to find a new one. That's been really stressful.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of your situation.

Patient: Sure, go ahead.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: No, I haven't.

Doctor: Do you have a family history of depression or other mental health conditions?

Patient: Yes, my mother has struggled with depression in the past.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to know. Based on our conversation, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression at this time. However, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor your symptoms and see how you're doing. In the meantime, I would recommend practicing self-care, like getting enough sleep, eating well, and exercising regularly. If your symptoms worsen or you experience any thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or seek emergency medical attention.

Patient: Okay, thank you for your help.
