Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there are many different factors that can contribute to these feelings. Let's talk a little bit more about your personal background and experiences to get a better idea of what might be going on.

Patient: Okay, sure.

After further discussion, the doctor concludes that the patient is not experiencing depression, but rather a difficult life transition that is causing temporary feelings of sadness and hopelessness. The doctor provides resources for coping with stress and suggests follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's progress.
