Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on. Have you been feeling down or depressed lately?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty low for a while now.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few months now. I just feel really sad and hopeless most of the time.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite.

Doctor: How about your energy levels? Have you been feeling more tired than usual?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I feel exhausted all the time.

Doctor: And have you been experiencing any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Are you married? Do you have kids?

Patient: I'm not married, but I do have a long-term partner. We don't have any kids.

Doctor: And how has your depression been affecting your daily life? Are you still able to work or do things you enjoy?

Patient: It's been really hard to get motivated to do anything. I've been missing work and I don't really enjoy doing anything anymore.

Doctor: Okay. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'd like to ask you a few more questions to get a better sense of your symptoms.
