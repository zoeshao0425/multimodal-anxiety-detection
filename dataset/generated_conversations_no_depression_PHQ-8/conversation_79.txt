Doctor: Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you here?

Patient: I’ve been feeling really down lately. I just can’t seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: I’m sorry to hear that. How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It’s been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual and I’ve lost my appetite.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything I do is wrong and I’m not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven’t had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Have you experienced any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but lately I just don’t want to do anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it’s been hard to focus on anything lately.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms like fatigue or aches and pains?

Patient: Yeah, I’ve been really tired and my body feels achy all the time.

Doctor: Thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a bit more about your personal background and any stressors in your life right now?

Patient: Well, I recently went through a breakup and that’s been really difficult for me. I’ve also been struggling with work and finances.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you’re going through a tough time right now. While it’s normal to feel sad after a breakup or during times of stress, it’s important to address these feelings if they’re interfering with your daily functioning. Based on our conversation, I don’t believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression at this time. However, I would like to refer you to a therapist who can help you work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.

Patient: Thank you, Doctor. That sounds like a good idea.
