Doctor: Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to rule out any other medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms. With that being said, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. It's possible that you may be experiencing a temporary period of sadness or low mood. I would recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms and seek help if they persist or worsen. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to improve your mood, such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep.
