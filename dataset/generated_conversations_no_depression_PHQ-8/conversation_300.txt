Doctor: So, can you tell me a bit about the symptoms you've been experiencing lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad almost every day. I have trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite.

Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or motivation?

Patient: Yeah, I feel really tired all the time and I don't have much interest in doing anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like nothing I do matters and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those thoughts.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms such as headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a bit about your personal life? Are there any stressors or major life changes that could be contributing to these symptoms?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and I've been struggling to find a new one. It's been causing a lot of financial stress and it's been hard on my self-esteem.

Doctor: I see. That could definitely be a contributing factor. However, based on what you've shared with me, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. It sounds like you're going through a tough time, but it's important to remember that these feelings are temporary and things will get better. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and advice.
