Doctor: Okay, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to ask a few more questions to make sure.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life events or changes recently, such as a loss of a loved one or a job?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Do you have a family history of depression or other mental health conditions?

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Based on your answers, it doesn't seem like you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I would like to keep an eye on your symptoms and see you back in a few weeks to reassess. In the meantime, it may be helpful to try some self-care strategies such as exercise, healthy eating, and spending time with loved ones. If your symptoms worsen or you have any thoughts of self-harm, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or another healthcare professional.
