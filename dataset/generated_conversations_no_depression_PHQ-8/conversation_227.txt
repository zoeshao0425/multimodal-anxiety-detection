Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any symptoms of depression?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just feel like I'm in a constant state of sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't really had much of an appetite lately. And I've been having trouble sleeping too. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you lost interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like doing anything. Everything seems pointless.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired lately. Even when I do manage to get some sleep, I still wake up feeling exhausted.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really sad and hopeless.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, I would say that you are not currently experiencing symptoms of depression. However, if you continue to feel this way or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to come back and see me.
