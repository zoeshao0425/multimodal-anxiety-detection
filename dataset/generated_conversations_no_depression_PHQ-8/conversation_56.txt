Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit more about how you're feeling?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really hopeless and helpless most of the time. I have trouble sleeping, and I don't really enjoy anything anymore. Even things that used to make me happy don't really do it for me anymore.

Doctor: Okay, those are definitely some symptoms of depression. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating less than usual, and I feel tired all the time. I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of suicide or self-harm?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really down and can't seem to shake it.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in your life lately? Any major changes or stressors?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and that's been really tough. I'm having trouble finding work, and money is tight. I've also been having some relationship problems with my partner.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Those are definitely some stressful situations to deal with. Have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my problems.

Doctor: It's important to reach out for help when you're struggling. There's no shame in asking for support. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?

Patient: I haven't, but maybe I should.

Doctor: I think that would be a good idea. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a depression screening questionnaire to fill out. It's called the PHQ-8, and it will give us a better idea of how severe your symptoms are.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

(Several minutes pass while the patient fills out the questionnaire)

Doctor: Based on your answers, it looks like you're not currently experiencing depression. However, I would still recommend seeking out counseling to help you deal with the stressors in your life and improve your overall well-being.

Patient: That sounds like a good plan. Thank you, doctor.

Doctor: Of course, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.
