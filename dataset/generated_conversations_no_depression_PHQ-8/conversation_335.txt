Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately? Have you been feeling down or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty depressed lately. It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Okay. Can you describe your symptoms for me? Have you been feeling sad or empty most of the day, nearly every day?

Patient: Yeah, definitely. I just feel really down and hopeless all the time. It's like there's this weight on my chest that won't go away.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight? Have you been eating more or less than usual?

Patient: I haven't really been eating much at all, to be honest. I just don't have much of an appetite these days.

Doctor: And how about your sleep? Have you been having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping. I just can't seem to turn my brain off at night.

Doctor: Have you noticed a decrease in your energy or motivation levels lately?

Patient: Definitely. I just feel so drained all the time. I don't have the energy to do anything anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately? Do you feel like you're a burden to others?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really worthless lately. Like I'm not good enough for anything or anyone. I just feel like a burden to everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of suicide or self-harm lately?

Patient: No, thankfully not. I don't think I could ever do anything like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. Based on your answers, it does sound like you have been experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I don't think your symptoms are severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of major depression. It sounds like you may be experiencing a mild or moderate form of depression.

Patient: Okay, that's good to know. What can I do to start feeling better?

Doctor: There are a few things we can try. First, I would recommend that you try to get more exercise and spend time outside in the sunlight. This can help improve your mood and energy levels. I would also recommend that you try to get more social support from friends and family. Finally, if your symptoms persist or worsen, we can talk about medication or therapy options.
