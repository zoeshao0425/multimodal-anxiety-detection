Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there could be other underlying causes for your symptoms. Let's talk more about your personal life and any recent changes or stressors that may be contributing to how you're feeling.

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and have been struggling to find a new one. I also went through a breakup with my girlfriend, which has been really hard on me.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It's understandable that those events could be contributing to your symptoms. However, based on our conversation and the PHQ-8 assessment, I don't believe that you have major depression. It's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and seeking support from loved ones or a mental health professional if needed.
