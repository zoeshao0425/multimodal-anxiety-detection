Doctor: So, I understand that you've been experiencing some symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a bit about what you've been feeling?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really down all the time. I don't have any energy and I'm not interested in doing anything anymore.

Doctor: I see. Have you been feeling this way for a long time?

Patient: Yeah, it's been going on for a few months now. I just don't seem to be able to shake it.

Doctor: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I haven't been sleeping very well lately and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel like eating anything.

Doctor: And have you been feeling hopeless or worthless at all?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I just feel like there's no point in anything. Like I'm not good enough and nothing will ever change.

Doctor: I understand. Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really sad and hopeless.

Doctor: Okay. Have you experienced any physical symptoms like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Alright. Can you tell me a bit about your personal life? Are you going through any major life changes or stresses right now?

Patient: Well, my job has been really stressful lately and my relationship with my partner is going through a rough patch. But other than that, everything else is pretty normal.

Doctor: I see. Alright, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I'd like to do a more thorough assessment to be sure.
