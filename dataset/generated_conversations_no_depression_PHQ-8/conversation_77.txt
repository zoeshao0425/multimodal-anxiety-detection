Doctor: So, can you tell me why you're here today?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: I see. When did you start feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just feel like I don't have any energy or motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Okay, and have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or others?

Patient: No, nothing like that. I just feel really sad all the time.

Doctor: Alright, let's go through some of the symptoms of depression. Have you been feeling down, depressed or hopeless?

Patient: Yes, definitely.

Doctor: Have you lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love going out with friends and doing things, but now I just don't feel like it.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: Definitely sleeping too much.

Doctor: Have you felt tired or had little energy?

Patient: Yes, I'm always tired.

Doctor: Alright, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I don't think it's severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. I would recommend some lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise and spending time with friends and family. If your symptoms persist or worsen, we can explore other treatment options.
