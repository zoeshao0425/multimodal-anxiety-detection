Doctor: So, let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. Have you experienced any of the following symptoms in the past two weeks?

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Have you been feeling down, depressed or hopeless?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: I have been feeling a bit low and uninterested in doing things I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: I used to love playing video games, but now I just don't feel like it anymore. I also used to enjoy spending time with my friends, but now I just don't feel like being around people.

Doctor: Do you experience any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've lost a bit of weight recently, but I think that's because I've been too busy to eat properly.

Doctor: How about trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I have been having trouble sleeping. I often wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep.

Doctor: Do you feel tired or have low energy?

Patient: Yes, I feel tired all the time, even when I get enough sleep.

Doctor: Have you felt guilty or worthless?

Patient: No, I don't feel guilty or worthless.

Doctor: Do you have trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, I do have trouble concentrating. I find it hard to focus on anything for too long.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it seems like you're experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that you haven't experienced all of the symptoms necessary for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. 

Patient: Okay, that's good to know.

Doctor: In your case, it might be helpful to try some self-care strategies like getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that you enjoy. It might also be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through some of the feelings you've been experiencing.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your advice.
