Doctor: Can you tell me a little about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and unmotivated. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any physical symptoms like changes in appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yes, actually. I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I've lost my appetite. I've also noticed that I've been losing weight without really trying.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I thought it was just a phase, but it hasn't gone away.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really low all the time. It's like there's a cloud hanging over me and I can't shake it.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I have. I just feel like I'm not good enough and that nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't. I don't think it's gotten that bad.

Doctor: Do you have a history of depression or other mental health conditions?

Patient: No, I don't. This is the first time I've felt like this.

Doctor: Have you experienced any significant life events or stressors recently?

Patient: Well, I did lose my job a few months ago, but I thought I was coping okay. Maybe it's been affecting me more than I realized.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I would like to administer a PHQ-8 assessment to get a better understanding of your symptoms.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

(After administering the PHQ-8 assessment)

Doctor: Based on your responses, it appears that you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, I would still like to monitor your symptoms and see how you're doing in a few weeks. In the meantime, I would encourage you to practice self-care and seek support from friends and family if needed.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That's a relief to hear. I'll definitely try to take care of myself better.
