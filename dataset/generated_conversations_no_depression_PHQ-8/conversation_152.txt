Doctor: Thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be causing these symptoms. I'd like to run some tests to make sure everything else is okay.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: After running some tests, everything came back normal. It seems like your symptoms are related to stress and anxiety rather than depression. I recommend seeking therapy to help manage these symptoms and improve your overall well-being. 

Patient: Thank you for your help, doctor. I will definitely consider therapy.
