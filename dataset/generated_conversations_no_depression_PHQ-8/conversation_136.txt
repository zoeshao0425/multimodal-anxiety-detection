Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about why you're here today?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really down lately. It's been hard to get out of bed and do anything.

Doctor: I see. How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Okay. Have you been feeling tired or fatigued?

Patient: Yes, I've been feeling really tired all the time.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been having trouble sleeping. I wake up a lot during the night and it's hard to fall back asleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I don't really enjoy anything anymore. I used to love going to the gym, but now I can barely make myself go.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there could be other factors at play as well. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal background and any stressors in your life right now?

Patient: Well, I just started a new job a few months ago and it's been really stressful. I also recently went through a breakup, which has been tough.

Doctor: I see. Those are definitely some major stressors. Have you tried any coping mechanisms or talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: No, I haven't really talked to anyone about it. I've just been trying to push through it.

Doctor: I would definitely recommend talking to someone about how you're feeling, whether it's a friend, family member, or a therapist. It's important to take care of your mental health just like you would take care of your physical health. Based on our conversation today, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression, but that doesn't mean that what you're feeling isn't valid. Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: No, I don't think so. Thank you for your help.

Doctor: Of course. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future.
