Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I've been feeling really down lately. I just don't have any motivation to do anything.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about how you've been feeling?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really sad and hopeless. I don't enjoy things that I used to love doing, like hanging out with friends or going to the movies. I also feel tired all the time, even when I get a good night's sleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Yeah, I've lost my appetite. I used to love eating, but now I just don't feel hungry. I've lost a few pounds over the past few weeks.

Doctor: And how about your sleep? Are you having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?

Patient: I have trouble falling asleep, but once I do fall asleep, I sleep for a long time. Sometimes I sleep for 10-12 hours and still feel tired when I wake up.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of guilt or worthlessness?

Patient: Yeah, I feel guilty all the time. I feel like I'm not good enough and that everything is my fault.

Doctor: Do you ever have thoughts of hurting yourself or suicidal thoughts?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those thoughts.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Do you have any stressors or major life changes happening right now?

Patient: Well, I just graduated from college and I'm having trouble finding a job. That's been really stressful for me. And my boyfriend and I broke up recently, which has been really hard.

Doctor: I see. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, you did not report any thoughts of hurting yourself, which is a good sign. I do not believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression at this time. However, I would like to monitor your symptoms and see you back in a few weeks to check in. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help improve your mood, such as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep. If you feel like your symptoms are getting worse, please don't hesitate to come back in sooner.
