Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?

Patient: Yeah, I've been eating a lot less than usual and I've lost some weight.

Doctor: Have you had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or have you been sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been having trouble falling asleep and I wake up a lot during the night. But then I'm exhausted during the day and I end up taking naps.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or your ability to concentrate?

Patient: I feel really tired all the time, and I can't focus on anything. Even simple tasks take me forever to complete.

Doctor: Have you felt guilty or worthless, or had thoughts of self-harm or suicide?
