Doctor: So, let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. Have you been experiencing any of the following symptoms over the past two weeks?

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?

Patient: Yes, I have.

Doctor: How often have you been feeling this way?

Patient: Almost every day.

Doctor: Have you lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, I have.

Doctor: Have you experienced a significant change in appetite or weight recently?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping.

Doctor: Have you felt tired or had a lack of energy?

Patient: Yes, I have.

Doctor: Have you felt guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yes, I have.

Doctor: Have you had difficulty concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, I have.

Doctor: Based on your responses, it seems like you're experiencing several symptoms of depression. Can you tell me more about how these symptoms are affecting your daily life?

Patient: Well, I've been having trouble getting out of bed in the morning and finding the motivation to do anything. I used to love going for walks and spending time with friends, but now I just feel like isolating myself. It's hard to focus at work, and I'm making mistakes that I wouldn't normally make. I just feel really down all the time.

Doctor: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Can you tell me a bit more about what might be causing these feelings? Is there anything stressful going on in your life right now?

Patient: Well, my mom has been really sick, and I'm worried about her. And work has been really busy and stressful lately.

Doctor: I can understand how those things might be contributing to your feelings of depression. Have you ever experienced depression before?

Patient: No, I haven't.

Doctor: Okay. Well, based on our conversation, it seems like you're experiencing some symptoms of depression, but not enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. However, I think it would still be helpful for you to talk to a therapist or counselor about what you're going through. They can work with you to develop coping strategies and provide support as you navigate this difficult time.

Patient: Okay, thank you. I appreciate your help.
