Patient: Yes, I have been feeling guilty and worthless. I feel like I'm not good enough and can't do anything right.

Doctor: Have you been having trouble concentrating or making decisions?

Patient: Yes, I have been having trouble concentrating and making decisions. I feel like my mind is foggy and I can't think straight.

Doctor: Have you been having thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't been having those thoughts.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and have been struggling to find a new one. It's been really stressful and I feel like I'm not good enough.

Doctor: I see. Losing a job can definitely be a difficult experience. Have you been able to talk to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden my family and friends with my problems.

Doctor: It's important to have a support system during difficult times. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?

Patient: I haven't thought about it, but maybe it would be helpful.

Doctor: I think it would be a good idea to look into therapy or counseling. In the meantime, I don't think you're experiencing depression at this time. However, please don't hesitate to reach out if your symptoms persist or worsen.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and advice.
