Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on your symptoms and what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing depression. However, it's important to note that not everyone with these symptoms has depression. I would like to run some tests to rule out any physical causes for your symptoms, but I also recommend seeking therapy to address any underlying emotional issues. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That makes sense to me.
