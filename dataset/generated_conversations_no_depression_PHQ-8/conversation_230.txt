Doctor: Can you tell me about the symptoms you've been experiencing lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad most of the time. I don't enjoy things I used to love doing, like going out with friends or watching movies. My sleep has also been affected, sometimes I can't fall asleep at all, and other times I sleep too much.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?

Doctor: How about your energy levels? Do you feel tired all the time?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time, and I don't have any motivation to do anything. Even getting out of bed feels like a chore.

Doctor: Have you experienced any feelings of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yes, I often feel like I'm not good enough, and I blame myself for everything that goes wrong in my life. I also feel guilty for not being able to snap out of this mood.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any suicidal thoughts, but I do feel like life is not worth living if I continue feeling this way.

Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: Yes, I have been having frequent headaches, and my stomach feels like it's always in knots. I also feel tense and restless most of the time.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes or stressors recently?

Patient: Yes, I lost my job a few months ago, and since then, I've been struggling to find a new one. I also went through a breakup, which has been really hard for me.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to do a full assessment to confirm the diagnosis.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for taking me seriously.

Doctor: After completing the PHQ-8 assessment, it appears that you do not meet the criteria for depression. However, it's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and seeking support if they worsen or persist.

Patient: That's a relief to hear. Thank you for your help and understanding.
