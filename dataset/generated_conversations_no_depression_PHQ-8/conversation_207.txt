Doctor: So, let's talk about how you've been feeling lately. Have you experienced little interest or pleasure in doing things?

Patient: Yes, actually. I used to enjoy going out with friends and doing hobbies, but now I don't feel like doing anything at all.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been about a month or so.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've lost my appetite and have lost a few pounds.

Doctor: How about your sleep? Have you been sleeping more or less than usual?

Patient: I've been having trouble sleeping. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or low on energy?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time. Even getting out of bed is a struggle.

Doctor: Have you been feeling bad about yourself or feeling like a failure?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty down lately. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm not achieving anything.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those thoughts.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your personal life? Do you have a support system, like family or friends?

Patient: I have a few close friends, but they've been busy lately and we haven't been able to hang out as much. My family lives far away, so I don't see them often.

Doctor: Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events recently?

Patient: Not really, no.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you are experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, you don't meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depression. It's possible that you are experiencing a milder form of depression called dysthymia. It's important to take care of yourself and seek support when you need it. I recommend that you try to engage in activities that you used to enjoy, even if you don't feel like it. Additionally, consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you work through your feelings.
