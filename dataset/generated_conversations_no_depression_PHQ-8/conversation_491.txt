Doctor: Have you experienced any physical symptoms such as headaches or stomach aches?

Patient: No, I haven't had any physical symptoms.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I want to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of your situation. Can you tell me a bit about your personal life and any recent events that may have caused stress?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job and I've been having trouble finding a new one. It's been really stressful trying to make ends meet.

Doctor: That's definitely a tough situation to be in. Have you talked to anyone about what you're going through?

Patient: Not really, I've just been keeping to myself.

Doctor: It's important to have a support system when going through difficult times. Have you considered talking to a therapist or joining a support group?

Patient: I haven't really thought about it, but I guess that could be helpful.

Doctor: I would definitely recommend looking into it. Based on our conversation, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. However, it's important to address your feelings and seek support to help you through this tough time.
