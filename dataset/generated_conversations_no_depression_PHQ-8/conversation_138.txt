Doctor: Can you tell me about any feelings of sadness or hopelessness you've experienced in the past two weeks?

Patient: Well, I have been feeling pretty down lately. I just don't feel like doing anything, and I don't really enjoy things that I used to.

Doctor: Have you experienced any loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I used to love going for walks and spending time with my friends, but now I just don't have the energy or motivation to do those things.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Not really. I haven't been eating as much as usual, but I haven't lost or gained any weight.

Doctor: How has your sleep been lately?

Patient: It's been pretty bad. I have trouble falling asleep at night, and I wake up a lot during the night.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy level or fatigue?

Patient: Yeah, I'm tired all the time. Even when I get a full night's sleep, I still feel exhausted.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of worthlessness or guilt?

Patient: Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough or that I'm letting people down.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of suicide or self-harm?

Patient: No, I haven't had any of those thoughts.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, since you haven't had any thoughts of suicide or self-harm, I don't think you meet the criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. I would recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms and come back to see me if they worsen or persist. In the meantime, I can refer you to a therapist who can help you work through some of these feelings and develop coping strategies.
