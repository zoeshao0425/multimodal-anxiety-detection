Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you're experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that some of these symptoms can also be caused by other factors. Have you experienced any significant life changes or stressors recently?

Patient: Actually, I just went through a breakup and it's been really tough on me.

Doctor: That could definitely be a contributing factor to how you're feeling. It's important to take care of yourself during this time and seek support from loved ones. However, based on the information you've provided, I don't believe you meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depression. 

Patient: That's a relief to hear. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me and help me understand what's going on.
