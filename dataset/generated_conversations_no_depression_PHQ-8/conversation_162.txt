Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a bit about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, I've been going through a lot of stress at work, and I've been having some relationship issues with my partner.

Doctor: I see. And have you talked to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I haven't felt like I could talk to anyone about it.

Doctor: I understand. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there are many different factors that can contribute to these symptoms, and it's possible that there may be other underlying issues at play as well. 

Patient: Okay, I appreciate your honesty.

Doctor: I'd like to do a full assessment to get a better understanding of your symptoms and how they're impacting your daily functioning. Based on the results of that assessment, we can develop a treatment plan that's tailored to your specific needs.

Patient: That sounds good to me.

Doctor: Okay, let's get started. After going through the assessment, I'm happy to say that you do not have depression. However, it's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and addressing any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of low mood. If you ever need someone to talk to, please don't hesitate to reach out.
