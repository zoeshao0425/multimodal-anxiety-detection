Doctor: How have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about that? How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now. I just feel like nothing is going right in my life and I can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleep or appetite?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel like eating anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your energy level or motivation?

Patient: Definitely. I used to be really active and motivated, but now I just feel so tired all the time and I don't have the energy to do anything.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really guilty about things that I shouldn't even be feeling guilty about. And I just feel like I'm not good enough and I'm not doing anything right.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that there are many different factors that can contribute to these feelings. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on in your life lately?

Patient: Well, I've been going through a tough time at work and I've also been having some relationship issues. It just feels like everything is piling up and I can't handle it.

Doctor: I see. It's understandable that those things would be causing you stress and sadness. However, I don't think that your symptoms meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression at this time. That being said, it's important to take care of yourself and seek support if you need it. Would you be interested in talking to a therapist or counselor about what you've been going through?

Patient: Yeah, I think that would be helpful. Thank you for your help. 

Doctor: Of course. It's important to take care of your mental health just as much as your physical health. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.
