Doctor: Okay, based on your answers, it seems like you are experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it's important to note that not everyone who experiences these symptoms has depression. I would like to do some further assessment to determine if a diagnosis of depression is appropriate.

Patient: Okay, that makes sense.

Doctor: Based on the assessment, I'm diagnosing you with not having depression. However, I do recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms and seek help if they persist or worsen. In the meantime, try to engage in activities that you enjoy and make sure to take care of yourself both physically and mentally.
