Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, after further assessment, I have determined that you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression at this time. It's possible that you may be experiencing a temporary period of sadness or stress, but we can work together to develop strategies to manage those feelings and improve your overall well-being.
