Patient: What kind of treatment do you recommend?

Doctor: There are a few different options, including therapy and medication. I can refer you to a therapist who can help you work through some of the underlying issues that may be contributing to your depression. And if necessary, we can discuss medication options as well.

Patient: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you for listening to me and helping me figure out what's going on.

Doctor: Of course, that's what I'm here for. Let's work together to get you feeling better soon.
