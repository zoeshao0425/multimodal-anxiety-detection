Doctor: So, you mentioned that you've been feeling down or hopeless recently. Can you tell me more about that?

Patient: Yeah, I just feel really sad all the time. Like I don't have any energy and I don't enjoy anything anymore.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: Probably for the last few months.

Doctor: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual and I've lost my appetite. I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything lately. I feel like I can't think straight.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, nothing like that.

Doctor: Okay, that's good to hear. Have you experienced any physical symptoms, like headaches or stomachaches?

Patient: No, not really.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your life lately? Any major stressors or changes?

Patient: Well, I lost my job a few months ago, and it's been really hard to find a new one. And my relationship with my partner has been strained lately.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately, which can definitely contribute to feelings of depression. However, based on your responses, it doesn't seem like you're experiencing severe depression. 

Patient: That's a relief to hear.

Doctor: Yes, but it's still important to take care of yourself and seek help if you need it. I recommend finding ways to manage your stress, like exercise or therapy, and staying connected with loved ones. And if your symptoms worsen or you start having thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to me or a mental health professional immediately.
