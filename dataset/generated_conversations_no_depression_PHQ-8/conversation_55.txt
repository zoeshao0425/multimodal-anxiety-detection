Doctor: So, how have you been feeling lately?

Patient: Honestly, not great. I've been feeling really down and hopeless.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling this way?

Patient: It's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, definitely. I used to love playing guitar, but now I can't even bring myself to pick it up.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Not really. I haven't been eating as much as I used to, but I haven't lost any weight.

Doctor: Have you had trouble sleeping or sleeping too much?

Patient: I've been having trouble falling asleep at night, and then I end up sleeping in really late in the morning.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired or lacking energy?

Patient: Yeah, I'm always exhausted no matter how much I sleep.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like everything is my fault and that I'm not good enough.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, since you haven't had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide, I don't think it's severe enough to warrant medication at this time. But I do recommend that you see a therapist to discuss your feelings and develop coping mechanisms.
