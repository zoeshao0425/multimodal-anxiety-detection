Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping and I've lost my appetite.

Doctor: Do you feel tired or have low energy throughout the day?

Doctor: Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I want to run some tests to rule out any other potential causes. 

Patient: Okay, that sounds good.

Doctor: After conducting some tests, I don't believe that you are experiencing depression. It's possible that you may be going through a difficult time, but it doesn't meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis. However, if these symptoms persist, please don't hesitate to come back and see me. In the meantime, I would suggest finding ways to practice self-care and seeking support from loved ones.
