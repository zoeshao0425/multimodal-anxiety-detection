Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad most of the time. It's been hard to find joy in things I used to enjoy.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any other symptoms like changes in appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble sleeping at night and I've lost my appetite. I've also been feeling really tired all the time.

Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?

Patient: I'd say it's been going on for a few weeks now.

Doctor: Have you ever experienced similar symptoms before?

Patient: Yes, I have had periods of feeling down before but this feels different. It's much more intense and I can't seem to shake it.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate or make decisions?

Patient: Yes, I've been having trouble focusing at work and making decisions has been really difficult.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others?

Patient: No, not at all.

Doctor: Have you experienced any significant life events recently that may have contributed to how you're feeling?

Patient: Actually, yes. My relationship ended a few months ago and I've been struggling to move on from it.

Doctor: Thank you for sharing that with me. Based on your responses, I'm going to diagnose you with mild depression. However, I don't believe medication is necessary at this time. Instead, I would suggest therapy to help you work through your feelings and develop coping mechanisms.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and advice.
