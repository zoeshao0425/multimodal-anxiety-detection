Doctor: So, tell me about how you've been feeling lately.

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad. I don't have any energy, and I've lost interest in things that used to make me happy.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me more about these feelings of sadness? How often do you feel this way?

Patient: It's pretty much every day. I wake up feeling hopeless and like there's no point in doing anything.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been sleeping a lot more than usual. And I don't really have much of an appetite anymore.

Doctor: I see. Have you been feeling guilty or worthless lately?

Patient: Yeah, I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm a burden on everyone around me.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, not really. I just feel really hopeless and like things will never get better.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me a bit about your personal life? Are you going through any significant life changes or stressors?

Patient: Well, I recently lost my job, and I've been having some relationship issues with my partner.

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a job and experiencing relationship problems can be really tough to deal with. Have you talked to anyone about these issues?

Patient: Not really. I've been keeping everything to myself because I don't want to burden anyone.

Doctor: I understand how you feel, but it's important to reach out for support when you're going through a tough time. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?

Patient: I haven't really thought about it, but maybe it could help.

Doctor: I think it would be a good idea to explore that option. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I'd like to do a quick assessment to get a better understanding of your condition.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: I'm going to ask you eight questions about how you've been feeling over the past two weeks. Please answer each question based on how often you've experienced each symptom.

1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things - Patient: Almost every day.
2. Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless - Patient: Almost every day.
3. Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much - Patient: Almost every day.
4. Feeling tired or having little energy - Patient: Almost every day.
5. Poor appetite or overeating - Patient: Almost every day.
6. Feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down - Patient: Almost every day.
7. Trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television - Patient: Almost every day.
8. Moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed? Or the opposite - being so fidgety or restless that you have been moving around a lot more than usual - Patient: Almost every day.

Doctor: Based on your responses, it appears that you are experiencing symptoms of depression. However, I would like to clarify that you do not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. I think it would be beneficial for you to seek therapy to help you cope with the stressors in your life and improve your mood. Additionally, I recommend that you engage in self-care activities such as exercise, healthy eating, and spending time with loved ones. 

Patient: Thank you for your help, doctor. I'll take your advice and seek therapy.
