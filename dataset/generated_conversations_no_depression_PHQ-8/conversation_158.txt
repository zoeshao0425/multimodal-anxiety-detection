Patient: No, I haven't experienced either of those.

Doctor: Based on your answers, it seems like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, it doesn't appear to be severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Instead, I would recommend that you focus on self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and engaging in activities that you enjoy. If your symptoms persist or worsen, we can explore other treatment options, such as therapy or medication. Do you have any questions or concerns?

Patient: No, that all makes sense. Thank you for your help.
