Doctor: So, tell me a little bit about what's been going on lately. Have you been feeling down or hopeless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty low for a while now. It's been hard to get out of bed in the morning and I just feel like I don't have any energy.

Doctor: Okay, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: Actually, yeah. I haven't really been eating much lately and I've lost a few pounds.

Doctor: How about your sleep? Have you been having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping. I'll lay in bed for hours and just can't seem to shut my brain off.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your interest in activities you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yeah, I used to love playing basketball with my friends, but lately I just don't have the motivation to do it anymore.

Doctor: Have you been feeling guilty or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling pretty worthless lately. Like nothing I do really matters.

Doctor: Have you been having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering those questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. Can you tell me a little bit more about what's been going on in your life recently?

Patient: Well, my girlfriend and I broke up a few months ago and it's been really tough. I've also been having some trouble at work and it's been stressing me out a lot.

Doctor: I see. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot of stressors lately. Have you tried talking to anyone about how you're feeling?

Patient: Not really. I don't want to burden my friends or family with my problems.

Doctor: I understand, but it's important to have a support system during difficult times. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?

Patient: No, I haven't really thought about that.

Doctor: Well, it might be something to consider. In the meantime, I don't think you meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis. However, I would encourage you to try to take care of yourself and find healthy ways to cope with your stressors. And if you ever do start having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please reach out for help immediately.

Patient: Thank you, I appreciate your help.
