Doctor: So, what brings you in today?

Patient: I have been feeling really down lately. I just can't seem to shake this feeling of sadness.

Doctor: Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about how you've been feeling?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really tired all the time. I don't have much energy and I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having trouble sleeping. I either can't fall asleep or I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I haven't really been hungry lately. I've lost a few pounds because I just don't feel like eating.

Doctor: Have you been feeling hopeless or worthless?

Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling like nothing really matters and that I'm not good at anything.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Can you tell me a little bit more about your daily life? How has depression impacted your ability to function?

Patient: It's been really hard to get through the day. I don't feel like doing anything, so I just sit around and watch TV. I've been missing work because I just can't seem to motivate myself to get out of bed.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. However, I would like to do a quick assessment to get a better understanding of your condition.
