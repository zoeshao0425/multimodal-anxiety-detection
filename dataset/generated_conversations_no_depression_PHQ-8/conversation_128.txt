Patient: Yes, actually, I have been feeling that way for a while now.

Doctor: Can you tell me more about how long you've been feeling this way?

Patient: I would say it's been going on for a few months now. I just can't seem to shake off this feeling of sadness and hopelessness.

Doctor: Okay, I understand. Do you experience a lack of pleasure or interest in activities that you used to enjoy?

Patient: Yes, I do. I used to love going out with friends, but now I just don't feel like doing anything.

Doctor: Do you have trouble sleeping or do you sleep too much?

Patient: I have trouble sleeping. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night and then I can't go back to sleep.

Doctor: Do you feel tired or have low energy levels most days?

Patient: Yes, I feel exhausted all the time. It's hard for me to get through the day without feeling drained.

Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?

Patient: I've lost my appetite lately. I just don't feel like eating much.

Doctor: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself or ending your life?

Patient: No, I haven't had any thoughts like that.

Doctor: Okay, thank you for answering these questions. Based on your responses, it seems like you may not be experiencing depression.
