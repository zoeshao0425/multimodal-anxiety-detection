Doctor: Hi, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?

Patient: Well, I've been feeling really down and sad most days. I don't have much energy and I don't enjoy things that I used to love doing.

Doctor: Have you been feeling this way for a while?

Patient: Yeah, it's been going on for a few months now.

Doctor: Okay, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: My appetite has decreased and I have trouble falling asleep at night.

Doctor: Do you ever feel hopeless or like life isn't worth living?

Patient: Sometimes I do. I feel like nothing will ever get better and that I'm just stuck in this rut.

Doctor: Have you noticed any physical symptoms like headaches or body aches?

Patient: Yeah, I've been having headaches more often than usual.

Doctor: Have you experienced any significant life events recently that may have contributed to these feelings?

Patient: My grandmother passed away a few months ago, and I've been struggling with grief since then.

Doctor: That's understandable. Have you talked to anyone about your feelings or sought help before?

Patient: No, I haven't really talked to anyone about it. I didn't want to burden anyone.

Doctor: It's important to reach out for help when you're struggling. Have you had any thoughts of self-harm or suicide?

Patient: No, I haven't.

Doctor: Okay, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. I'm going to give you a questionnaire to fill out so we can get a better idea of how you're feeling.

(Patient fills out PHQ-8 questionnaire)

Doctor: Based on your answers, you're not currently experiencing depression. However, it's important to continue monitoring your symptoms and seeking help if they persist or worsen. I recommend talking to a therapist or counselor about your grief and feelings of sadness. They can provide you with coping strategies and support.
