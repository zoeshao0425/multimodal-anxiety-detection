Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns?

Patient: Yeah, it's been really hard to focus on anything. I feel like I can't make even the simplest decisions.

Doctor: Thank you for answering all of my questions. Based on your answers, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, your score on the PHQ-8 assessment indicates that you do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of depression. It's possible that you're experiencing situational depression or another related condition. I'd like to suggest that we continue monitoring your symptoms and discuss some treatment options that may help you feel better. 

Patient: Thank you, doctor. That makes me feel a little better. I appreciate your help.
